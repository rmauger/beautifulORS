The action shall be commenced against the person in the actual possession of the property at the time, or if the property is not in the actual possession of anyone, then against the person acting as the owner of the property.
subsec|(2) In an action brought under subsection (1) of this section or in a separate action for damages only, a person who, throughout the vesting period, used or occupied land of another with the honest and objectively reasonable belief that the person was the actual legal owner of the land shall not be liable for:
para|(a) Double or treble damages under ORS 105.810 (1) to (3) or 105.815; or
para|(b) The value of the use or occupation of the land by the person throughout the vesting period.

subsec|(2) That the plaintiff is entitled to the possession thereof.
subsec|(3) That the defendant wrongfully withholds the property from the plaintiff to the damage of the plaintiff for such sum as is therein claimed.

slug|A defendant who is in actual possession may, for answer, plead that the defendant is in possession only as tenant of another; naming the landlord and the place of residence of the landlord. Thereupon the landlord, if the landlord applies therefor, shall be made defendant in place of the tenant and the action shall proceed in all respects as if originally commenced against the landlord. If the landlord does not apply to be made defendant within the day the tenant is allowed to answer, the landlord shall not be allowed to, but shall be made defendant if the plaintiff requires it. If the landlord is made defendant on motion of the plaintiff the landlord shall be required to appear and answer within 10 days from notice of the pendency of the action and the order making the landlord defendant, or such further notice as the court or judge thereof may prescribe.

subsec|(2) If the verdict is for the defendant, that the plaintiff is not entitled to the possession of the property described in the complaint, or the part that the defendant defends, and the estate, license or right to possession in such property established on the trial by the defendant, if any, as the same is required to be pleaded.

When permanent improvements have been made upon the property by the defendant, or those under whom the defendant claims, while holding under color of title in good faith and adverse to the claim of the plaintiff, the value of the improvements at the time of trial shall be allowed as a setoff against such damages.

subsec|(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the judgment in an action to recover the possession of real property is conclusive as to the estate in the property and the right to the possession thereof, so far as the same is thereby determined, upon the party against whom the judgment is given, and against all persons claiming from, through or under such party, after the commencement of the action.
subsec|(2) When service of the summons is made by publication and judgment is given for want of an answer, at any time within two years from the entry thereof the defendant or the successor in interest of the defendant as to the whole or any part of the property, shall, upon application to the court or judge thereof, be entitled to an order vacating the judgment and granting the defendant a new trial upon the payment of the costs of the action.
subsec|(3) In an action against a tenant the judgment is conclusive against a landlord, who has been made defendant in place of the tenant, to the same extent as if the action had been originally commenced against the landlord.

slug|In an action at law for the recovery of the possession of real property, if either party claims the property as a donee of the United States under the Act of Congress approved September 27, 1850, commonly called the Donation Law, or the Acts amendatory thereto, such party from the date of settlement of the party on the property, as provided in said Acts, is deemed to have a legal estate in fee in the property. The estate shall continue upon the condition that the party performs the conditions required by such Acts, and is unconditional and indefeasible after the performance of such condition. If both plaintiff and defendant claim title to the same real property by virtue of settlement under such Acts, the settlement and the performance of the subsequent conditions shall be conclusively presumed in favor of the party having, or claiming under, the elder patent certificate or patent, unless it appears upon the face of such certificate or patent that it is absolutely void.

Nothing in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 prevents such action from being maintained for the recovery of the possession of real property although the entry of the defendant is forcible or the holding is unlawful and with force as defined in ORS 105.105.

subsec|(1) If the defendant raises a defense under ORS 90.449 based upon the defendant’s status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking and the perpetrator is a tenant of the dwelling unit, the court may issue an order terminating the tenancy of the perpetrator and ordering the perpetrator to vacate the dwelling unit without terminating the tenancy of the other tenants and without awarding possession to the plaintiff.
subsec|(2) If the action is based upon a notice terminating the tenancy of a perpetrator under ORS 90.445, the court may issue an order upholding the termination of the perpetrator’s tenancy and ordering the perpetrator to vacate the dwelling unit without the tenancy of the other tenants being terminated and without awarding possession to the plaintiff.

subsec|(1) For the purposes of this section:
para|(a) "Time of distribution" means the time when a disclaimed interest would have taken effect through possession or enjoyment.
para|(b) "Future interest" means an interest that takes effect through possession or enjoyment, if at all, at a time later than the time that the interest is created.
subsec|(2) Except for a disclaimer governed by ORS 105.634 or 105.636, the following rules apply to a disclaimer of an interest in property:
para|(a) The disclaimer takes effect when the instrument creating the interest becomes irrevocable or, if the interest arises under the law of intestate succession, when the decedent dies.
para|(b) The disclaimed interest passes according to any provision in the instrument creating the interest providing for the disposition of the specific interest in the event the interest is disclaimed, or according to any provision in the instrument creating the interest providing for the disposition of interests in general in the event the interests created by the instrument are disclaimed.
subsec|(3) If the instrument creating the interest does not contain a provision described in subsection (2)(b) of this section, or if the interest arises under the law of intestate succession, the following rules apply:
para|(a)
subpara|(A) If the disclaimant is an individual, except as otherwise provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the time of distribution.
subpara|(B) If by law or under the instrument the descendants of the disclaimant would share in the disclaimed interest by any method of representation had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes only to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of distribution.
subpara|(C) If the disclaimed interest would pass to the disclaimant’s estate had the disclaimant died before the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest instead passes by representation to the descendants of the disclaimant who survive the time of distribution. If no descendant of the disclaimant survives the time of distribution, the disclaimed interest passes to those persons, including the state, but excluding the disclaimant, and in such shares, as would succeed to the transferor’s intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the transferor’s domicile had the transferor died at the time of distribution. However, if the transferor’s surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time of distribution, the transferor is deemed to have died unmarried at the time of distribution.
para|(b) If the disclaimant is not an individual, the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant did not exist.
subsec|(4) Upon the disclaimer of a preceding interest, a future interest held by a person other than the disclaimant takes effect as if the disclaimant had died or ceased to exist immediately before the time of distribution, but a future interest held by the disclaimant is not accelerated in possession or enjoyment.
