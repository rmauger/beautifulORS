      (1) The Legislative Assembly finds that:
     </li>
     <ol class="lvl2">
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (1)(a)">
       (a) There is a significant number of rental properties in this state whose owners have obtained rural rental housing loans from Rural Development or the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture under 7 C.F.R. 3560. Many of these rental properties contain rental units in which very low, low and moderate income families, elderly persons and persons with disabilities live and receive federal rental assistance.
      </li>
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (1)(b)">
       (b) Beginning in 2015, many of the mortgage loans made to the owners of these rental properties will mature and federal rental assistance to tenants residing on the premises of these rental properties will no longer be available.
      </li>
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (1)(c)">
       (c) Currently, there is no legal mechanism in place requiring the owners of these rental properties to provide notice of loan maturity to tenants, the Housing and Community Services Department, housing authorities as defined in ORS 456.005 and local governments.
      </li>
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (1)(d)">
       (d) Requiring notice at least one year before maturity of a loan described in paragraph (a) of this subsection would provide:

       <li title="ORS 456.500 (1)(d)(B)">
        (B) The Housing and Community Services Department, housing authorities and local governments with time to work with Rural Development or the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture to develop arrangements that will protect the housing status of existing tenants.
       </li>

     </ol>
     <li title="ORS 456.500 (2)">
      (2) The owner of any rental property that has received a rural rental housing loan from Rural Development or the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture under 7 C.F.R. 3560 shall provide written notice by first class mail with postage prepaid and by posting in a common area on the rental property notice of all of the following:

     <ol class="lvl2">

     <li title="ORS 456.500 (3)">
      (3) The notice required by subsection (2) of this section must be mailed to:
     </li>
     <ol class="lvl2">
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (3)(a)">
       (a) Any tenant residing on the premises of the rental property that is the subject of the loan, mailed to the street address of the premises on which the tenant resides, on or after the date that is one year before the date of loan maturity;
      </li>
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (3)(b)">

       (c) The local housing authority as defined in ORS 456.375 that is located in the county or area of operation in which the rental property is located; and
      </li>
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (3)(d)">

      </li>
      <li title="ORS 456.500 (4)(b)">
       (b) Providing notice less than one year before the date of loan maturity entitles a tenant residing on the premises of the rental property on the date that is at least one year before the date of loan maturity to continue residing on the premises of the rental property without any increase in the tenant’s portion of the rent charged for a period of time that equals the number of days that the notice was late.

       (c) If the tenant begins residency at a time that is less than one year before the date of loan maturity, the tenant must receive the notice required by this section prior to entering into a rental agreement. Failure to provide the notice required by this paragraph entitles the tenant to continue residing on the premises of the rental property without any increase in the tenant’s portion of the rent charged for up to one year after the date of loan maturity, or one year after termination of the tenant’s federal rental assistance, program use restrictions or rent controls, whichever date is later.

     <li title="ORS 456.502 (2)">
      (2) The department or the program administrator, with the department’s approval, may make loans to eligible organizations to purchase land on which to develop affordable housing and to build facilities intended to provide supportive services to affordable housing residents and low income households in the nearby community.

     <li title="ORS 456.502 (3)">
      (3) Organizations that are eligible to participate in the program include local governments, local housing authorities, nonprofit community or neighborhood-based organizations, federally recognized Indian tribes in this state and regional or statewide nonprofit housing assistance organizations.
     </li>
     <li title="ORS 456.502 (4)">
      (4) Each eligible organization must include in the organization’s loan application a proposed affordable housing development plan that indicates the number of affordable housing units planned, a description of any other facilities that are being considered for the property and an estimated timeline for completion of the development. The department or the department’s program administrator may require additional information from eligible organizations and may consider the efficient use of land, project readiness, organizational capacity and other factors as criteria in making loans.
     </li>
     <li title="ORS 456.502 (5)">
      (5) Forty percent of loans made by the program shall go to eligible organizations operating home ownership programs for low income households. If the entire 40 percent cannot be loaned to the types of eligible organizations described in this subsection, the remainder may be loaned to other eligible organizations under subsection (6) of this section.

The updated development plan must be substantially consistent with the development plan submitted as part of the original loan application required in subsection (4) of this section.

     <li title="ORS 456.502 (8)">
      (8) Within eight years of receiving a loan under this section, a loan recipient must complete development of affordable housing on the property for which the loan was made and place the affordable housing into service.

     </li>
     <ol class="lvl2">
      <li title="ORS 456.502 (10)(a)">
       (a) If a loan recipient does not place affordable housing into service on a property for which a loan was received under this section within the eight-year period specified in subsection (8) of this section, or if a loan recipient fails to use the property for the intended affordable housing purpose consistent with the loan recipient’s original affordable housing development plan, the loan recipient must pay to the department an amount consisting of the principal of the original loan plus compounded interest calculated at the current market rate. The department shall develop guidelines for the time period in which this repayment must take place and include the time period in the original loan agreement entered into with the loan recipient. The department may grant a partial or total exemption from this repayment requirement if the department determines that a development is substantially complete or that the property has been substantially used as described in the original affordable housing development plan.

      <li title="ORS 456.502 (10)(b)">
       (b) As used in this subsection, "current market rate" means the current average market interest rate that is determined at the time any individual loan is closed upon using a widely recognized current market interest rate measurement to be selected for use by the department or by the program administrator, with the approval of the department. This interest rate must be noted in an attachment to the closing documents for each loan.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <li title="ORS 456.502 (11)">
      (11) The department, or the program administrator with the approval of the department, may adopt guidelines and requirements that are necessary to administer the program.
