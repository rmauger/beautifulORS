<li>(2) This section does not affect the power of a testator in the disposition of real property by a last will and testament, nor to prevent a trust from arising or being extinguished by implication or operation of law, nor to affect the power of a court to compel the specific performance of an agreement in relation to such property. </li>

<li>(4) If the statement of consideration is in the body of the instrument preceding the signatures, execution of the instrument shall constitute a certification of the truth of the statement. If there is a separate statement of consideration on the face of the instrument, it shall be signed separately from the instrument, and such execution shall constitute a certification of the truth of the statement by the person signing. A particular form is not required for the statement so long as the requirements of this section are reasonably met. </li>
