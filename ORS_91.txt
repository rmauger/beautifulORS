The landlord must provide the applicant with a receipt for any applicant screening charge.para|(b) A landlord may only require an applicant to pay a single applicant screening charge within any 60-day period, regardless of the number of rental units owned or managed by the landlord for which the applicant has applied to rent.sub_sec|(2) The amount of any applicant screening charge must not be greater than the landlord's average actual cost of screening applicants. Actual costs may include the cost of using a tenant screening company or a consumer credit reporting agency, and may include the reasonable value of any time spent by the landlord or the landlord's agents in otherwise obtaining information on applicants. In any case, the applicant screening charge must not be greater than the customary amount charged by tenant screening companies or consumer credit reporting agencies for a comparable level of screening.sub_sec|(3) A landlord may not require payment of an applicant screening charge unless prior to accepting the payment the landlord:para|(a) Adopts written screening or admission criteria;para|(b) Gives written notice to the applicant of:sub_para|(A) The amount of the applicant screening charge;sub_para|(B) The landlord's screening or admission criteria;sub_para|(C) The process that the landlord typically will follow in screening the applicant, including whether the landlord uses a tenant screening company, credit reports, public records or criminal records or contacts employers, landlords or other references; andsub_para|(D) The applicant's rights to dispute the accuracy of any information provided to the landlord by a screening company or credit reporting agency;para|(c) Gives actual notice to the applicant of an estimate, made to the best of the landlord's ability at that time, of the approximate number of rental units of the type, and in the area, sought by the applicant that are, or within a reasonable future time will be, available to rent from that landlord. The estimate shall include the approximate number of applications previously accepted and remaining under consideration for those units. A good faith error by a landlord in making an estimate under this paragraph does not provide grounds for a claim under subsection (8)(b) of this section;para|(d) Gives written notice to the applicant of the amount of rent the landlord will charge and the deposits the landlord will require, subject to change in the rent or deposits by agreement of the landlord and the tenant before entering into a rental agreement; andpara|(e) Gives written notice to the applicant whether the landlord requires tenants to obtain and maintain renter's liability insurance and, if so, the amount of insurance required.sub_sec|(4) Regardless of whether a landlord requires payment of an applicant screening charge, if a landlord denies an application for a rental agreement by an applicant and that denial is based in whole or in part on a tenant screening company or consumer credit reporting agency report on that applicant, the landlord shall give the applicant actual notice of that fact at the same time that the landlord notifies the applicant of the denial.

In addition, if the landlord knew or should have reasonably known of the existence of the conditions, the tenant may recover either two months' periodic rent or twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant as a result of the violation, whichever is greater.

For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme is more extreme or serious than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. Acts that are "outrageous in the extreme" include, but are not limited to, the following acts by a person:sub_para|(A) Prostitution, commercial sexual solicitation or promoting prostitution, as described in ORS 167.007, 167.008 and 167.012;sub_para|(B) Unlawful manufacture, delivery or possession of a controlled substance, as defined in ORS 475.005;sub_para|(C) Manufacture of a cannabinoid extract, as defined in ORS 475B.015, unless the person manufacturing the cannabinoid extract holds a license issued under ORS 475B.090 or is registered under ORS 475B.840;sub_para|(D) A bias crime, as described in ORS 166.155 and 166.165; orsub_para|(E) Burglary as described in ORS 164.215 and 164.225.sub_sec|(2) If the cause for a termination notice given pursuant to subsection (1) of this section is based upon the acts of the tenant's pet, the tenant may cure the cause and avoid termination of the tenancy by removing the pet from the premises prior to the end of the notice period. The notice must describe the right of the tenant to cure the cause. If the tenant returns the pet to the premises at any time after having cured the violation, the landlord, after at least 24 hours' written notice specifying the subsequent presence of the offending pet, may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation.sub_sec|(3) For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, someone is in the tenant's control if that person enters or remains on the premises with the tenant's permission or consent after the tenant reasonably knows or should know of that person's act or likelihood to commit any act of the type described in subsection (1) of this section.sub_sec|(4) An act can be proven to be outrageous in the extreme even if the act is one that does not violate a criminal statute. Notwithstanding the references to criminal statutes in subsection (1)(f) of this section, the landlord's burden of proof in an action for possession under subsection (1) of this section is the civil standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.sub_sec|(5) If a good faith effort by a landlord to terminate the tenancy under subsection (1)(f) of this section and to recover possession of the rental unit under ORS 105.105 to 105.168 fails by decision of the court, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance requiring the landlord to remove that tenant upon threat of fine, abatement or forfeiture as long as the landlord continues to make a good faith effort to terminate the tenancy.source_note|[2005 c.391 §9; 2007 c.71 §23; 2011 c.151 §5; 2015 c.98 §3; 2016 c.24 §54; 2017 c.21 §33; 2019 c.553 §11]sub_title|90.398 Termination of tenancy for drug or alcohol violations.

If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (19) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.para|(e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (19)(c), (d) and (f)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.para|(f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the dwelling or home, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord's approval for occupancy of a purchaser, heir or devisee or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.

Unless the representative or person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the representative or person.para|(h) Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the representative or person.sub_sec|(21) If the personal property is other than a manufactured dwelling or floating home and is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant and who owned the personal property, this section applies except as follows:para|(a) The following persons have the same rights and responsibilities regarding the abandoned personal property as a tenant:sub_para|(A) An heir or devisee.sub_para|(B) Any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased tenant.sub_para|(C) Any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant's death.para|(b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:sub_para|(A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises;sub_para|(B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any heir, devisee, personal representative or designated person, if actually known to the landlord; andsub_para|(C) Sent by first class mail to the attention of an estate administrator of the Department of State Lands.para|(c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to the heir, devisee, personal representative, designated person or estate administrator of the department, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.para|(d) The landlord shall allow a person that is an heir, devisee or personal representative of the tenant, or an estate administrator of the department, to remove the personal property if the person contacts the landlord within the period provided by subsection (6) of this section, complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is an heir, devisee or personal representative, or an estate administrator of the department.para|(e) If neither an heir, devisee nor personal representative of the tenant, nor an estate administrator of the department, contacts the landlord within the time period provided by subsection (6) of this section, the landlord shall allow removal of the personal property by the designated person of the tenant, if the designated person contacts the landlord within that period and complies with the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence that the person is the designated person.para|(f) A landlord who allows removal of personal property under this subsection is not liable to another person that has a claim or interest in the personal property.sub_sec|(22) If a governmental agency determines that the condition of a manufactured dwelling, floating home or recreational vehicle abandoned under this section constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law and the agency determines that the hazard endangers others in the immediate vicinity and requires quick removal of the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this subsection.

A storage charge may not be due more frequently than monthly;sub_para|(B) The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no greater than for late charges described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant; andsub_para|(C) The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and obligations described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant.para|(e) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord's approval of a purchaser or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval of any purchaser who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.

Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.sub_para|(C) A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14 days' written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the rented space if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as provided in the agreement.para|(g) Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the lienholder.sub_sec|(20) If the personal property is a manufactured dwelling or floating home and is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only tenant and who owned the dwelling or home, this section applies, except as follows:para|(a) The following persons have the same rights and responsibilities regarding the abandoned dwelling or home as a tenant:sub_para|(A) Any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased tenant.sub_para|(B) Any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord in the event of the tenant's death.para|(b) The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:sub_para|(A) Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; andsub_para|(B) Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative or designated person, if actually known to the landlord.para|(c) The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.para|(d) If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the representative or person providing that the dwelling or home may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (19) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.para|(e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (19)(c), (d) and (f)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.para|(f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the dwelling or home, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord's approval for occupancy of a purchaser, heir or devisee or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee who wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee of the dwelling or home upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.para|(g) If the representative or person violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days' written notice to the representative or person stating facts sufficient to notify the representative or person of the reason for the termination.

Payments must be itemized as a separate charge from the utility or service charge. The landlord must give each tenant a copy of the plan at least 90 days before the first payment is due. Payments may not be due before the completion of the installation, and must begin within six months after completion.

If the utility or service provider cannot provide an accurate cost for the service to the common areas, the landlord shall assume the cost of serving the common areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed. This offset is not available if the landlord chooses to bill for the common areas using pro rata billing.sub_sec|(9) If storm water service and wastewater service are not measured by the submeter, a landlord that installs submeters to measure water consumption and converts to submeter billing from rent-included billing under this section may continue to recover the cost of the storm water service or wastewater service in the rent or may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submeters, convert the billing for the storm water service or wastewater service to pro rata billing by including the change in the notice and meeting required by subsection (2) of this section. If the landlord converts the billing for the storm water service or wastewater service to pro rata billing, the landlord must reduce the rent to reflect that charge, as required by subsection (6) of this section.sub_sec|(10) A rental agreement amended under this section must include language that fairly describes the provisions of this section.sub_sec|(11) If a landlord installs a submeter on an existing utility or service line to a space or common area that is already served by that line, unless the installation causes a system upgrade, a local government may not assess a system development charge as defined in ORS 223.299 as a result of the installation.source_note|[Formerly 90.537]sub_title|90.576 Legislative findings.

The notice shall describe the risk of harm.sub_sec|(5) The notice required by subsections (3) and (4) of this section must:para|(a) State facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the specific disrepair or deterioration that is the cause or reason for termination of the tenancy and removal of the dwelling or home;para|(b) State that the tenant can avoid termination and removal by correcting the cause for termination and removal within the notice period;para|(c) If reasonably known by the landlord, describe specifically what repairs are required to correct the disrepair or deterioration that is the cause for termination;para|(d) Describe the tenant's right to give the landlord a written notice of correction, where to give the notice and the deadline for giving the notice in order to ensure a response by the landlord, all as provided by subsection (7) of this section; andpara|(e) Describe the tenant's right to have the termination and correction period extended as provided by subsection (8) of this section.sub_sec|(6) The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the cause within the period specified.

Within a reasonable time after the tenant's notice of correction, the landlord shall respond to the tenant in writing, stating whether the landlord agrees that the cause has been corrected. If the tenant's notice of correction is given at least 14 days prior to the end of the termination notice or extension period, failure by the landlord to respond as required by this subsection is a defense to a termination based upon the landlord's notice for termination.sub_sec|(8) Except when the disrepair or deterioration creates a risk of imminent and serious harm to dwellings, homes or persons within the facility, the 60-day period provided for the tenant to correct the cause for termination and removal shall be extended by at least:para|(a) An additional 60 days if:sub_para|(A) The necessary correction involves exterior painting, roof repair, concrete pouring or similar work and the weather prevents that work during a substantial portion of the 60-day period; orsub_para|(B) The nature or extent of the correction work is such that it cannot reasonably be completed within 60 days because of factors such as the amount of work necessary, the type and complexity of the work and the availability of necessary repair persons;para|(b) An additional six months if the disrepair or deterioration has existed for more than the preceding 12 months with the landlord's knowledge or acceptance as described in ORS 90.412; orpara|(c) An additional 10 months if the disrepair or deterioration relates to the float of a floating home.sub_sec|(9) In order to have the period for correction extended as provided in subsection (8) of this section, a tenant must give the landlord written notice describing the necessity for an extension in order to complete the correction work. The notice must be given a reasonable amount of time prior to the end of the notice for termination period.sub_sec|(10) A tenancy terminates on the date designated in the notice and without regard to the expiration of the period for which, by the terms of the rental agreement, rents are to be paid.

A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.para|(b) The lienholder's right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the tenant or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home within the allotted time.para|(c) To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b) of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of this section. A lienholder enters into a storage agreement by signing a copy of the agreement provided by the landlord and personally delivering or mailing the signed copy to the landlord within the 60-day period.

The lienholder shall have 90 days after entering into the storage agreement to make the repairs. Failure to make the repairs within the allotted time constitutes a violation of the storage agreement and the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 14 days' written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.para|(e) Notwithstanding subsection (7)(b) of this section, a landlord may increase the storage charge if the increase is part of a facility-wide rent increase for all facility tenants, the increase is no greater than the increase for other tenants and the landlord gives the lienholder written notice consistent with the requirements of ORS 90.600.para|(f) During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680.

A storage agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to subsection (20) of this section until the agreement with the personal representative or designated person ends.para|(e) If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter into a storage agreement, subsection (20)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of this section applies, with the representative or person having the rights and responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.para|(f) During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680.
