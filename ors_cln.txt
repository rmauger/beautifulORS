[Formerly 91.730]|90.135  Unconscionability.  (1) If the court, as a matter of law, finds:|(a)  A rental agreement or any provision thereof was unconscionable when made, the  court may refuse to enforce the agreement, enforce the remainder of the  agreement without the unconscionable provision, or limit the application of any  unconscionable provision to avoid an unconscionable result; or|(b)  A settlement in which a party waives or agrees to forgo a claim or right under  this chapter or under a rental agreement was unconscionable when made, the  court may refuse to enforce the settlement, enforce the remainder of the  settlement without the unconscionable provision, or limit the application of  any unconscionable provision to avoid an unconscionable result.|(2)  If unconscionability is put into issue by a party or by the court upon its own  motion the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present  evidence as to the setting, purpose and effect of the rental agreement or  settlement to aid the court in making the determination. |[Formerly 91.735]|90.140  Types of payments landlord may require or accept; written evidence of payment.

The writing may be a receipt, statement of the tenant’s account or  other acknowledgment of the tenant’s payment. The writing must include the  amount paid, the date of payment and information identifying the landlord or  the rental property. If the tenant makes the payment by mail, deposit or a  method other than in person and requests the writing, the landlord shall within  a reasonable time provide the tenant with the writing in a manner consistent  with ORS 90.150. |[1997 c.577 §4; 1999 c.603 §7; 2001 c.596 §29; 2005 c.22 §58;  2005 c.391 §13; 2005 c.619 §16]|90.145  Tenant or applicant who conducts repairs, routine maintenance or cleaning  services not employee of landlord; restrictions.

[1995 c.773 §2; 1999 c.676 §9; 2005 c.758 §6]|90.147  Delivery of possession. For the purposes of this chapter, delivery of  possession occurs:|(1)  From the landlord to the tenant, when the landlord gives actual notice to the  tenant that the tenant has the right under a rental agreement to occupy the  dwelling unit to the exclusion of others. The right to occupy may be implied by  actions such as the landlord’s delivery of the keys to the dwelling unit; and|(2)  From the tenant to the landlord at the termination of the tenancy, when:|(a)  The tenant gives actual notice to the landlord that the tenant has relinquished  any right to occupy the dwelling unit to the exclusion of others.  Relinquishment of the right to occupy may be implied by actions such as the  tenant’s return of the keys to the dwelling unit;|(b)  After the expiration date of an outstanding termination of tenancy notice or  the end of a term tenancy, the landlord reasonably believes under all the  circumstances that the tenant has relinquished or no longer claims the right to  occupy the dwelling unit to the exclusion of others; or|(c)  The landlord reasonably knows of the tenant’s abandonment of the dwelling unit.  [1995 c.559 §9; 1999 c.603 §8]|90.148  Landlord acts that imply acceptance of tenant abandonment or relinquishment of  right to occupy.  The surrender of a dwelling unit may be implied from the landlord’s acceptance  of a tenant’s abandonment or relinquishment of the right to occupy. The  landlord’s acceptance may be demonstrated by acts of the landlord that are  inconsistent with the existence of the tenancy. A landlord’s receipt of the  keys to the dwelling unit or a landlord’s reasonable efforts to mitigate the  landlord’s damages by attempting to rent the dwelling unit to a new tenant  shall not constitute acts inconsistent with the existence of the tenancy.  Reasonable efforts to mitigate damages include preparing the unit for rental. [1999  c.603 §2]|Note: 90.148 was added  to and made a part of ORS chapter 90 by legislative action but was not added to  any smaller series therein.

In order for a written rental agreement to provide  for mail and attachment service of written notices from the landlord to the  tenant, the agreement must also provide for such service of written notices  from the tenant to the landlord. Mail and attachment service of written notices  shall be executed as follows:|(A)  For written notices from the landlord to the tenant, the first class mail  notice copy shall be addressed to the tenant at the premises and the second  notice copy shall be attached in a secure manner to the main entrance to that  portion of the premises of which the tenant has possession; and|(B)  For written notices from the tenant to the landlord, the first class mail  notice copy shall be addressed to the landlord at an address as designated in  the written rental agreement and the second notice copy shall be attached in a  secure manner to the landlord’s designated location, which shall be described  with particularity in the written rental agreement, reasonably located in  relation to the tenant and available at all hours.|(2)  If a notice is served by mail, the minimum period for compliance or termination  of tenancy, as appropriate, shall be extended by three days, and the notice  shall include the extension in the period provided.|(3)  A landlord or tenant may utilize alternative methods of notifying the other so  long as the alternative method is in addition to one of the service methods  described in subsection (1) of this section.|(4)  After 30 days’ written notice, a landlord may unilaterally amend a rental  agreement for a manufactured dwelling or floating home that is subject to ORS  90.505 to 90.850 to provide for service or delivery of written notices by mail  and attachment service as provided by subsection (1)(c) of this section.

If the tenant does not obtain  renter’s liability insurance within the 30-day period:|(a)  The landlord may terminate the tenancy pursuant to ORS 90.392; and|(b)  The tenant may cure the cause of the termination as provided by ORS 90.392 by  obtaining insurance.|(4)  A landlord may require that the tenant provide documentation:|(a)  That the tenant has named the landlord as an interested party on the tenant’s  renter’s liability insurance policy authorizing the insurer to notify the  landlord of:|(A)  Cancellation or nonrenewal of the policy;|(B)  Reduction of policy coverage; or|(C)  Removal of the landlord as an interested party; or|(b)  On a periodic basis related to the coverage period of the renter’s liability  insurance policy or more frequently if the landlord reasonably believes that  the insurance policy is no longer in effect, that the tenant maintains the  renter’s liability insurance.|(5)  A landlord may require that a tenant obtain or maintain renter’s liability  insurance only if the landlord obtains and maintains comparable liability  insurance and provides documentation to any tenant who requests the  documentation, orally or in writing.

In any action on a rental agreement or arising under this chapter, reasonable  attorney fees at trial and on appeal may be awarded to the prevailing party  together with costs and necessary disbursements, notwithstanding any agreement  to the contrary. As used in this section, "prevailing party" means the party in  whose favor final judgment is rendered. |[Formerly 91.755]|90.260  Late rent payment charge or fee; restrictions; calculation. (1) A landlord  may impose a late charge or fee, however designated, only if:|(a)  The rent payment is not received by the fourth day of the weekly or monthly  rental period for which rent is payable; and|(b)  There exists a written rental agreement that specifies:|(A)  The tenant’s obligation to pay a late charge on delinquent rent payments;|(B)  The type and amount of the late charge, as described in subsection (2) of this  section; and|(C)  The date on which rent payments are due and the date or day on which late  charges become due.|(2)  The amount of any late charge may not exceed:|(a)  A reasonable flat amount, charged once per rental period. "Reasonable amount"  means the customary amount charged by landlords for that rental market;|(b)  A reasonable amount, charged on a per-day basis, beginning on the fifth day of  the rental period for which rent is delinquent. This daily charge may accrue  every day thereafter until the rent, not including any late charge, is paid in  full, through that rental period only. The per-day charge may not exceed six  percent of the amount described in paragraph (a) of this subsection; or|(c)  Five percent of the periodic rent payment amount, charged once for each  succeeding five-day period, or portion thereof, for which the rent payment is  delinquent, beginning on the fifth day of that rental period and continuing and  accumulating until that rent payment, not including any late charge, is paid in  full, through that rental period only.|(3)  In periodic tenancies, a landlord may change the type or amount of late charge  by giving 30 days’ written notice to the tenant.|(4)  A landlord may not deduct a previously imposed late charge from a current or  subsequent rental period rent payment, thereby making that rent payment  delinquent for imposition of a new or additional late charge or for termination  of the tenancy for nonpayment under ORS 90.394.|(5)  A landlord may charge simple interest on an unpaid late charge at the rate  allowed for judgments pursuant to ORS 82.010 (2) and accruing from the date the  late charge is imposed.|(6)  Nonpayment of a late charge alone is not grounds for termination of a rental  agreement for nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394, but is grounds for  termination of a rental agreement for cause under ORS 90.392 or 90.630 (1). A  landlord may note the imposition of a late charge on a nonpayment of rent  termination notice under ORS 90.394, so long as the notice states or otherwise  makes clear that the tenant may cure the nonpayment notice by paying only the  delinquent rent, not including any late charge, within the allotted time.|(7)  A late charge includes an increase or decrease in the regularly charged  periodic rent payment imposed because a tenant does or does not pay that rent  by a certain date. |[1989 c.506 §15; 1995 c.559 §8; 1997 c.249 §30; 1997 c.577 §9a;  1999 c.603 §12; 2005 c.391 §16; 2007 c.906 §32a]|90.262  Use and occupancy rules and regulations; adoption; enforceability;  restrictions.  (1) A landlord, from time to time, may adopt a rule or regulation, however  described, concerning the tenant’s use and occupancy of the premises. It is  enforceable against the tenant only if:|(a)  Its purpose is to promote the convenience, safety or welfare of the tenants in  the premises, preserve the landlord’s property from abusive use, or make a fair  distribution of services and facilities held out for the tenants generally;|(b)  It is reasonably related to the purpose for which it is adopted;|(c)  It applies to all tenants in the premises in a fair manner;|(d)  It is sufficiently explicit in its prohibition, direction or limitation of the  tenant’s conduct to fairly inform the tenant of what the tenant must or must  not do to comply;|(e)  It is not for the purpose of evading the obligations of the landlord; and|(f)  The tenant has written notice of it at the time the tenant enters into the  rental agreement, or when it is adopted.|(2)  If a rule or regulation adopted after the tenant enters into the rental  agreement works a substantial modification of the bargain, it is not valid  unless the tenant consents to it in writing.|(3)  If adopted, an occupancy guideline for a dwelling unit shall not be more  restrictive than two people per bedroom and shall be reasonable. Reasonableness  shall be determined on a case-by-case basis. Factors to be considered in  determining reasonableness include, but are not limited to:|(a)  The size of the bedrooms;|(b)  The overall size of the dwelling unit; and|(c)  Any discriminatory impact on those identified in ORS 659A.421.|(4)  As used in this section:|(a)  "Bedroom" means a habitable room that:|(A)  Is intended to be used primarily for sleeping purposes;|(B)  Contains at least 70 square feet; and|(C)  Is configured so as to take the need for a fire exit into account.|(b)  "Habitable room" means a space in a structure for living, sleeping, eating or  cooking. Bathrooms, toilet compartments, closets, halls, storage or utility  space and similar areas are not included. [Formerly 90.330]|90.263  Vehicle tags.  A landlord may not require that a tenant display a nonremovable tag, sticker or  other device on a motor vehicle that might reveal or indicate to the public the  premises where the tenant resides. |[1999 c.397 §2]|Note: 90.263 was added  to and made a part of ORS chapter 90 by legislative action but was not added to  any smaller series therein. See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further  explanation.|90.265  Interest in alternative energy device installed by tenant. (1) An  alternative energy device installed in a dwelling unit by a tenant with the  landlord’s written permission is not a fixture in which the landlord has a  legal interest, except as otherwise expressly provided in a written agreement  between the landlord and tenant.|(2)  As a condition to a grant of written permission referred to in subsection (1)  of this section, a landlord may require a tenant to do one or more of the  following:|(a)  Provide a waiver of the landlord’s liability for any injury to the tenant or  other installer resulting from the tenant’s or installer’s negligence in the  installation of the alternative energy device;|(b)  Secure a waiver of the right to a lien against the property of the landlord  from each contractor, subcontractor, laborer and material supplier who would  obtain the right to a lien when the tenant installs or causes the installation  of the alternative energy device; or|(c)  Post a bond or pay a deposit in an amount not to exceed the cost of restoring  the premises to its condition at the time of installation of the alternative  energy device.|(3)  Nothing in this section:|(a)  Authorizes the installation of an alternative energy device in a dwelling unit  without the landlord’s written permission; or|(b)  Limits a landlord’s right to recover damages and obtain injunctive relief as  provided in ORS 90.401.|(4)  As used in this section, "alternative energy device" has the meaning given that  term in ORS 469B.100.

(1) As provided  under this section, a landlord may allow an individual to become a temporary  occupant of the tenant’s dwelling unit. To create a temporary occupancy, the  landlord, tenant and proposed temporary occupant must enter into a written  temporary occupancy agreement that describes the temporary occupancy  relationship.|(2)  The temporary occupant:|(a)  Is not a tenant entitled to occupy the dwelling unit to the exclusion of  others; and|(b)  Does not have the rights of a tenant.|(3)  The temporary occupancy agreement may be terminated by:|(a)  The tenant without cause at any time; and|(b)  The landlord only for cause that is a material violation of the temporary  occupancy agreement.|(4)  The temporary occupant does not have a right to cure a violation that causes a  landlord to terminate the temporary occupancy agreement.|(5)  Before entering into a temporary occupancy agreement, a landlord may screen the  proposed temporary occupant for issues regarding conduct or for a criminal  record. The landlord may not screen the proposed temporary occupant for credit  history or income level.|(6)  A temporary occupancy agreement:|(a)  Shall expressly include the requirements of subsections (2) to (4) of this  section;|(b)  May provide that the temporary occupant is required to comply with any  applicable rules for the premises; and|(c)  May have a specific ending date.|(7)  The landlord, tenant and temporary occupant may extend or renew a temporary  occupancy agreement or may enter into a new temporary occupancy agreement.|(8)  A landlord or tenant is not required to give the temporary occupant written  notice of the termination of a temporary occupancy agreement.|(9)  The temporary occupant shall promptly vacate the dwelling unit if a landlord  terminates a temporary occupancy agreement for material violation of the  temporary occupancy agreement or if the temporary occupancy agreement ends by  its terms. Except as provided in ORS 90.449, the landlord may terminate the  tenancy of the tenant as provided under ORS 90.392 or 90.630 if the temporary  occupant fails to promptly vacate the dwelling unit or if the tenant materially  violates the temporary occupancy agreement.|(10)  A temporary occupant shall be treated as a squatter if the temporary occupant  continues to occupy the dwelling unit after a tenancy has ended or after the  tenant revokes permission for the occupancy by terminating the temporary  occupancy agreement.|(11)|(a)  A landlord may not enter into a temporary occupancy agreement for the purpose  of evading landlord responsibilities under this chapter or to diminish the  rights of an applicant or tenant under this chapter.|(b)  A tenant may not become a temporary occupant in the tenant’s own dwelling unit.|(c)  A tenancy may not consist solely of a temporary occupancy. Each tenancy must  have at least one tenant. |[2009 c.431 §6 and 2009 c.816 §15; 2013 c.294 §5] FEES  AND DEPOSITS|90.295  Applicant screening charge; limitations; notice upon denial of tenancy; refund;  remedy.  (1)(a) A landlord may require payment of an applicant screening charge solely  to cover the costs of obtaining information about an applicant as the landlord  processes the application for a rental agreement. This activity is known as  screening, and includes but is not limited to checking references and obtaining  a consumer credit report or tenant screening report. The landlord must provide  the applicant with a receipt for any applicant screening charge.|(b)  A landlord may only require an applicant to pay a single applicant screening  charge within any 60-day period, regardless of the number of rental units owned  or managed by the landlord for which the applicant has applied to rent.|(2)  The amount of any applicant screening charge must not be greater than the  landlord’s average actual cost of screening applicants. Actual costs may  include the cost of using a tenant screening company or a consumer credit  reporting agency, and may include the reasonable value of any time spent by the  landlord or the landlord’s agents in otherwise obtaining information on  applicants. In any case, the applicant screening charge must not be greater  than the customary amount charged by tenant screening companies or consumer  credit reporting agencies for a comparable level of screening.|(3)  A landlord may not require payment of an applicant screening charge unless  prior to accepting the payment the landlord:|(a)  Adopts written screening or admission criteria;|(b)  Gives written notice to the applicant of:|(A)  The amount of the applicant screening charge;|(B)  The landlord’s screening or admission criteria;|(C)  The process that the landlord typically will follow in screening the applicant,  including whether the landlord uses a tenant screening company, credit reports,  public records or criminal records or contacts employers, landlords or other  references; and|(D)  The applicant’s rights to dispute the accuracy of any information provided to  the landlord by a screening company or credit reporting agency;|(c)  Gives actual notice to the applicant of an estimate, made to the best of the  landlord’s ability at that time, of the approximate number of rental units of  the type, and in the area, sought by the applicant that are, or within a  reasonable future time will be, available to rent from that landlord. The  estimate shall include the approximate number of applications previously  accepted and remaining under consideration for those units. A good faith error  by a landlord in making an estimate under this paragraph does not provide  grounds for a claim under subsection (8)(b) of this section;|(d)  Gives written notice to the applicant of the amount of rent the landlord will  charge and the deposits the landlord will require, subject to change in the  rent or deposits by agreement of the landlord and the tenant before entering  into a rental agreement; and|(e)  Gives written notice to the applicant whether the landlord requires tenants to  obtain and maintain renter’s liability insurance and, if so, the amount of  insurance required.|(4)  Regardless of whether a landlord requires payment of an applicant screening  charge, if a landlord denies an application for a rental agreement by an  applicant and that denial is based in whole or in part on a tenant screening  company or consumer credit reporting agency report on that applicant, the  landlord shall give the applicant actual notice of that fact at the same time  that the landlord notifies the applicant of the denial. Unless written notice  of the name and address of the screening company or credit reporting agency has  previously been given, the landlord shall promptly give written notice to the  applicant of the name and address of the company or agency that provided the  report upon which the denial is based.|(5)  Except as provided in subsection (4) of this section, a landlord need not  disclose the results of an applicant screening or report to an applicant, with  respect to information that is not required to be disclosed under the federal  Fair Credit Reporting Act. A landlord may give to an applicant a copy of that  applicant’s consumer report, as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act.|(6)  Unless the applicant agrees otherwise in writing, a landlord may not require  payment of an applicant screening charge when the landlord knows or should know  that no rental units are available at that time or will be available within a  reasonable future time.|(7)  A landlord that requires an applicant screening charge must refund the  applicant screening charge to the applicant within a reasonable time if the  landlord:|(a)  Fills the vacant dwelling unit before screening the applicant; or|(b)  Does not screen the applicant for any reason.|(8)|(a)  An applicant may not recover an applicant screening charge from the landlord if  the tenant refuses an offer from the landlord to rent the dwelling unit.|(b)  The applicant may recover from the landlord twice the amount of any applicant  screening charge paid, plus $150, if:|(A)  The landlord fails to comply with this section with respect to the applicant’s  screening or screening charge; or|(B)  The landlord does not conduct a screening of the applicant for any reason and  fails to refund an applicant screening charge to the applicant within a  reasonable time. [1993 c.369 §26; 1995 c.559 §10; 1997 c.577 §11; 1999 c.603 §14;  2011 c.42 §2; 2013 c.294 §6; 2019 c.251 §1]|90.297  Prohibition on charging deposit or fee to enter rental agreement; exceptions;  deposit allowed for securing execution of rental agreement; remedy. (1) Except as  provided in ORS 90.295 and in this section, a landlord may not charge a deposit  or fee, however designated, to an applicant who has applied to a landlord to  enter a rental agreement for a dwelling unit.|(2)  A landlord may charge a deposit, however designated, to an applicant for the  purpose of securing the execution of a rental agreement, after approving the  applicant’s application but prior to entering into a rental agreement. The  landlord must give the applicant a written statement describing:|(a)  The amount of rent and the fees the landlord will charge and the deposits the  landlord will require; and|(b)  The terms of the agreement to execute a rental agreement and the conditions for  refunding or retaining the deposit.|(3)  If a rental agreement is executed, the landlord shall either apply the deposit  toward the moneys due the landlord under the rental agreement or refund it  immediately to the tenant.|(4)  If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the applicant to  comply with the agreement to execute, the landlord may retain the deposit.|(5)  If a rental agreement is not executed due to a failure by the landlord to  comply with the agreement to execute, within four days the landlord shall  return the deposit to the applicant either by making the deposit available to  the applicant at the landlord’s customary place of business or by mailing the  deposit by first class mail to the applicant.|(6)  If a landlord fails to comply with this section, the applicant or tenant, as  the case may be, may recover from the landlord the amount of any fee or deposit  charged, plus $150. [1995 c.559 §11; 2001 c.596 §30; 2011 c.42 §3]|90.300  Security deposits; prepaid rent. (1) As used in this section, "security  deposit" includes any last month’s rent deposit.|(2)|(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, a landlord may require a tenant  to pay a security deposit. The landlord shall provide the tenant with a receipt  for any security deposit the tenant pays. The landlord shall hold a security  deposit or prepaid rent for the tenant who is a party to the rental agreement.  A tenant’s claim to the security deposit or prepaid rent is prior to the claim  of a creditor of the landlord, including a trustee in bankruptcy.|(b)  Except as provided in ORS 86.782 (10), the holder of the landlord’s interest in  the premises at the time the tenancy terminates is responsible to the tenant  for any security deposit or prepaid rent and is bound by this section.|(3)  A written rental agreement, if any, must list a security deposit paid by a  tenant or required by a landlord.|(4)  A landlord may not charge a tenant a pet security deposit for keeping a service  animal or companion animal that a tenant with a disability requires as a  reasonable accommodation under fair housing laws.|(5)|(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a landlord may not change the  rental agreement to require the tenant to pay a new or increased security  deposit during the first year after the tenancy has begun. Subject to  subsection (4) of this section, the landlord may require an additional deposit  if the landlord and tenant agree to modify the terms and conditions of the  rental agreement to permit a pet or for other cause and the additional deposit  relates to the modification. This paragraph does not prevent a landlord from  collecting a security deposit that an initial rental agreement provided for but  that remained unpaid at the time the tenancy began.|(b)  If a landlord requires a new or increased security deposit after the first year  of the tenancy, the landlord shall allow the tenant at least three months to  pay the new or increased deposit.|(6)  The landlord may claim all or part of the security deposit only if the landlord  required the security deposit for any or all of the purposes specified in  subsection (7) of this section.|(7)|(a)  The landlord may claim from the security deposit only the amount reasonably  necessary:|(A)  To remedy the tenant’s defaults in the performance of the rental agreement  including, but not limited to, unpaid rent; and|(B)  To repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant, not including ordinary  wear and tear.|(b)  A landlord is not required to repair damage caused by the tenant in order for  the landlord to claim against the deposit for the cost to make the repair. Any  labor costs the landlord assesses under this subsection for cleaning or repairs  must be based on a reasonable hourly rate. The landlord may charge a reasonable  hourly rate for the landlord’s own performance of cleaning or repair work.|(c)  Defaults and damages for which a landlord may recover under this subsection  include, but are not limited to:|(A)  Carpet cleaning, other than the use of a common vacuum cleaner, if:|(i)  The cleaning is performed by use of a machine specifically designed for  cleaning or shampooing carpets;|(ii)  The carpet was cleaned or replaced after the previous tenancy or the most  recent significant use of the carpet and before the tenant took possession; and|(iii)  The written rental agreement provides that the landlord may deduct the cost of  carpet cleaning regardless of whether the tenant cleans the carpet before the  tenant delivers possession as described in ORS 90.147.|(B)  Loss of use of the dwelling unit during the performance of necessary cleaning  or repairs for which the tenant is responsible under this subsection if the  cleaning or repairs are performed in a timely manner.|(8)  A landlord may not require a tenant to pay or to forfeit a security deposit or  prepaid rent to the landlord for the tenant’s failure to maintain a tenancy for  a minimum number of months in a month-to-month tenancy.|(9)  The landlord must apply any last month’s rent deposit to the rent due for the  last month of the tenancy:|(a)  When either the landlord or the tenant gives to the other a notice of  termination, pursuant to this chapter, other than a notice of termination under  ORS 90.394;|(b)  When the landlord and tenant agree to terminate the tenancy; or|(c)  When the tenancy terminates in accordance with the provisions of a written  rental agreement for a term tenancy.|(10)  A landlord shall account for and refund as provided in subsections (12) to (14)  of this section any portion of a last month’s rent deposit the landlord does  not apply as provided under subsection (9) of this section. Unless the tenant  and landlord agree otherwise, the tenant may not require the landlord to apply  a last month’s rent deposit to rent due for any period other than the last  month of the tenancy. A last month’s rent deposit does not limit the amount of  rent charged unless a written rental agreement provides otherwise.|(11)  When the tenancy terminates, a landlord shall account for and refund to the  tenant, in the same manner this section requires for security deposits, the  unused balance of any prepaid rent the landlord has not previously refunded to  the tenant under ORS 90.380 and 105.120 (5)(b) or any other provision of this  chapter. The landlord may claim from the remaining prepaid rent only the amount  reasonably necessary to pay the tenant’s unpaid rent.|(12)  In order to claim all or part of any prepaid rent or security deposit, within  31 days after the tenancy terminates and the tenant delivers possession the  landlord shall give to the tenant a written accounting that states specifically  the basis or bases of the claim. The landlord shall give a separate accounting  for security deposits and for prepaid rent.|(13)  The landlord shall return to the tenant the security deposit or prepaid rent or  the portion of the security deposit or prepaid rent that the landlord does not  claim in the manner provided by subsections (11) and (12) of this section not  later than 31 days after the tenancy terminates and the tenant delivers  possession to the landlord.|(14)  The landlord shall give the written accounting required under subsection (12)  of this section or shall return the security deposit or prepaid rent as  required by subsection (13) of this section by personal delivery or by first  class mail.|(15)  If a security deposit or prepaid rent secures a tenancy for a space for a  manufactured dwelling or floating home the tenant owns and occupies, whether or  not in a facility, and the dwelling or home is abandoned as described in ORS  90.425 (2) or 90.675 (2), the 31-day period described in subsections (12) and  (13) of this section commences on the earliest of:|(a)  Waiver of the abandoned property process under ORS 90.425 (26) or 90.675 (24);|(b)  Removal of the manufactured dwelling or floating home from the rented space;|(c)  Destruction or other disposition of the manufactured dwelling or floating home  under ORS 90.425 (10)(b) or 90.675 (10)(b); or|(d)  Sale of the manufactured dwelling or floating home pursuant to ORS 90.425  (10)(a) or 90.675 (10)(a).|(16)  If the landlord fails to comply with subsection (13) of this section or if the  landlord in bad faith fails to return all or any portion of any prepaid rent or  security deposit due to the tenant under this chapter or the rental agreement,  the tenant may recover the money due in an amount equal to twice the amount:|(a)  Withheld without a written accounting under subsection (12) of this section; or|(b)  Withheld in bad faith.|(17)|(a)  A security deposit or prepaid rent in the possession of the landlord is not  garnishable property, as provided in ORS 18.618.|(b)  If a landlord delivers a security deposit or prepaid rent to a garnishor in  violation of ORS 18.618 (1)(b), the landlord that delivered the security  deposit or prepaid rent to the garnishor shall allow the tenant at least 30  days after a copy of the garnishee response required by ORS 18.680 is delivered  to the tenant under ORS 18.690 to restore the security deposit or prepaid rent.  If the tenant fails to restore a security deposit or prepaid rent under the  provisions of this paragraph before the tenancy terminates, and the landlord  retains no security deposit or prepaid rent from the tenant after the  garnishment, the landlord is not required to refund or account for the security  deposit or prepaid rent under subsection (11) of this section.|(18)  This section does not preclude the landlord or tenant from recovering other  damages under this chapter.

The landlord:|(A)  Shall give a tenant a written warning notice that describes:|(i)  A specific noncompliance before charging a fee for a second or subsequent  noncompliance for the same or similar conduct; and|(ii)  The amount of the fee for a second noncompliance, and for any subsequent  noncompliance, that occurs within one year after the warning notice.|(B)  Shall give a tenant a written notice describing the noncompliance when  assessing a fee for a second or subsequent noncompliance that occurs within one  year after the warning notice.|(C)  Shall give a warning notice for a noncompliance or assess a fee for a second or  subsequent noncompliance within 30 days after the act constituting  noncompliance.|(D)  May terminate a tenancy for a noncompliance consistent with this chapter  instead of assessing a fee under this subsection, but may not assess a fee and  terminate a tenancy for the same noncompliance.|(E)  May not deduct a fee assessed pursuant to this subsection from a rent payment  for the current or a subsequent rental period.|(b)  A landlord may charge a tenant a fee for occurrences of noncompliance with  written rules or policies as provided in paragraph (a) of this subsection for  the following types of noncompliance:|(A)  The late payment of a utility or service charge that the tenant owes the  landlord as described in ORS 90.315.|(B)  Failure to clean up pet waste from a part of the premises other than the  dwelling unit.|(C)  Failure to clean up the waste of a service animal or a companion animal from a  part of the premises other than the dwelling unit.|(D)  Failure to clean up garbage, rubbish and other waste from a part of the  premises other than the dwelling unit.|(E)  Parking violations.|(F)  The improper use of vehicles within the premises.|(G)  Smoking in a clearly designated nonsmoking unit or area of the premises.

A tenant’s payment for a given utility or service benefits the  landlord or other tenants if the utility or service is delivered to any area  other than the tenant’s dwelling unit.|(3)  If the landlord knowingly fails to disclose those matters required under  subsection (2) of this section, the tenant may recover twice the actual damages  sustained or one month’s rent, whichever is greater.|(4)|(a)  Except for tenancies covered by ORS 90.505 to 90.850, if a written rental  agreement so provides, a landlord may require a tenant to pay to the landlord a  utility or service charge or a public service charge that has been billed by a  utility or service provider to the landlord for utility or service provided  directly, or for a public service provided indirectly, to the tenant’s dwelling  unit or to a common area available to the tenant as part of the tenancy. A utility  or service charge that shall be assessed to a tenant for a common area must be  described in the written rental agreement separately and distinctly from such a  charge for the tenant’s dwelling unit.|(b)|(A)  If a rental agreement provides that a landlord may require a tenant to pay a  utility or service charge, the landlord must bill the tenant in writing for the  utility or service charge within 30 days after receipt of the provider’s bill.  If the landlord includes in the bill to the tenant a statement of the rent due,  the landlord must separately and distinctly state the amount of the rent and  the amount of the utility or service charge.|(B)  The landlord must provide to the tenant, in the written rental agreement or in  a bill to the tenant, an explanation of:|(i)  The manner in which the provider assesses a utility or service charge; and|(ii)  The manner in which the charge is allocated among the tenants if the provider’s  bill to the landlord covers multiple tenants.|(C)  The landlord must:|(i)  Include in the bill to the tenant a copy of the provider’s bill; or|(ii)  If the provider’s bill is not included, state that the tenant may inspect the  provider’s bill at a reasonable time and place and that the tenant may obtain a  copy of the provider’s bill by making a request to the landlord during the  inspection and upon payment to the landlord for the reasonable cost of making  copies.|(D)  A landlord may require that a bill to the tenant for a utility or service  charge is due upon delivery of the bill. A landlord shall treat the tenant’s  payment as timely for purposes of ORS 90.302 (3)(b)(A) if the payment is made  by a date that is specified in the bill and that is not less than 30 days after  delivery of the bill.|(E)  If a written rental agreement so provides, the landlord may deliver a bill to  the tenant as provided in ORS 90.155 or by electronic means.|(c)  Except as provided in this paragraph, a utility or service charge may only  include the cost of the utility or service as billed to the landlord by the  provider. A landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service  charge billed to the tenant if:|(A)  The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for  cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for  Internet access or usage;|(B)  The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service  charge billed to the tenant;|(C)  The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less  than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted  directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other  video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;|(D)  The written rental agreement providing for the utility or service charge  describes the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or  service charge; and|(E)  Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge  lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or  service charge.|(d)|(A)  A landlord must provide 60 days’ written notice to a tenant before the landlord  may amend an existing rental agreement for a month-to-month tenancy to require  a tenant to pay a public service charge that was adopted by a utility or  service provider or a local government within the previous six months.|(B)  A landlord may not hold a tenant liable for a public service charge billed to a  previous tenant.|(C)  A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing  rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the  amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to  pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video  subscription services or for Internet access or usage as provided under  paragraph (c) of this subsection.|(e)  A utility or service charge, including any additional amount added pursuant to  paragraph (c) of this subsection, is not rent or a fee. Nonpayment of a utility  or service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for  nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394 but is grounds for termination of a rental  agreement for cause under ORS 90.392.|(f)  If a landlord fails to comply with paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this  subsection, the tenant may recover from the landlord an amount equal to one  month’s periodic rent or twice the amount wrongfully charged to the tenant,  whichever is greater.|(5)|(a)  If a tenant, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or  service and is unable to obtain the service prior to moving into the premises  due to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount due by a previous tenant or the  owner, the tenant may either:|(A)  Pay the outstanding amount and deduct the amount from the rent;|(B)  Enter into a mutual agreement with the landlord to resolve the lack of service;  or|(C)  Immediately terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice  and the reason for the termination.|(b)  If the tenancy terminates, the landlord shall return all moneys paid by the  tenant as deposits, rent or fees within four days after termination.|(6)  If a tenant, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or  service and is unable to obtain the service after moving into the premises due  to a nonpayment of an outstanding amount due by a previous tenant or the owner,  the tenant may either:|(a)  Pay the outstanding amount and deduct the amount from the rent; or|(b)  Terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice 72 hours  prior to the date of termination and the reason for the termination. The  tenancy does not terminate if the landlord restores service or the availability  of service during the 72 hours. If the tenancy terminates, the tenant may  recover actual damages from the landlord resulting from the shutoff and the  landlord shall return:|(A)  Within four days after termination, all rent and fees; and|(B)  All of the security deposit owed to the tenant under ORS 90.300.|(7)  If a landlord, under the rental agreement, is responsible for a utility or  service and the utility or service is shut off due to a nonpayment of an  outstanding amount, the tenant may either:|(a)  Pay the outstanding balance and deduct the amount from the rent; or|(b)  Terminate the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice 72 hours  prior to the date of termination and the reason for the termination. The  tenancy does not terminate if the landlord restores service during the 72  hours. If the tenancy terminates, the tenant may recover actual damages from  the landlord resulting from the shutoff and the landlord shall return:|(A)  Within four days after termination, all rent prepaid for the month in which the  termination occurs prorated from the date of termination or the date the tenant  vacates the premises, whichever is later, and any other prepaid rent; and|(B)  All of the security deposit owed to the tenant under ORS 90.300.|(8)  If a landlord fails to return to the tenant the moneys owed as provided in  subsection (5), (6) or (7) of this section, the tenant shall be entitled to  twice the amount wrongfully withheld.|(9)  This section does not preclude the tenant from pursuing any other remedies  under this chapter.

The  landlord or landlord’s agent may not enter if the tenant, after receiving the landlord’s  notice, denies consent to enter. The tenant must assert this denial of consent  by giving actual notice of the denial to the landlord or the landlord’s agent  or by attaching a written notice of the denial in a secure manner to the main  entrance to that portion of the premises or dwelling unit of which the tenant  has exclusive control, prior to or at the time of the attempt by the landlord  or landlord’s agent to enter.|(2)  A landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. A  tenant may not unreasonably withhold consent from the landlord to enter.|(3)  This section does not apply to tenancies consisting of a rental of space in a  facility for a manufactured dwelling or floating home under ORS 90.505 to  90.850.|(4)  If a tenancy consists of rented space for a manufactured dwelling or floating  home that is owned by the tenant, but the tenancy is not subject to ORS 90.505  to 90.850 because the space is not in a facility, this section shall allow  access only to the rented space and not to the dwelling or home.|(5)  A landlord has no other right of access except:|(a)  Pursuant to court order;|(b)  As permitted by ORS 90.410 (2); or|(c)  When the tenant has abandoned or relinquished the premises.|(6)  If a landlord is required by a governmental agency to enter a dwelling unit or  any portion of the premises under a tenant’s exclusive control, but the  landlord fails to gain entry after a good faith effort in compliance with this  section, the landlord may not be found in violation of any state statute or  local ordinance due to the failure.|(7)  If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain  injunctive relief to compel access or may terminate the rental agreement under  ORS 90.392 and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. In  addition, the landlord may recover actual damages.|(8)  If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or a lawful entry in an unreasonable  manner or makes repeated demands for entry otherwise lawful but that have the  effect of unreasonably harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive  relief to prevent the reoccurrence of the conduct or may terminate the rental  agreement pursuant to ORS 90.360 (1). In addition, the tenant may recover  actual damages not less than an amount equal to one week’s rent in the case of  a week-to-week tenancy or one month’s rent in all other cases. |[Formerly  90.335; 1997 c.577 §18; 1999 c.603 §19; 1999 c.676 §12; 2005 c.391 §20]|90.323  Maximum rent increase; exceptions; notice.

(1)(a) Except as provided in this  chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental  agreement or a noncompliance with ORS 90.320 or 90.730, the tenant may deliver  a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting  the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less  than 30 days after delivery of the notice if the breach is not remedied in seven  days in the case of an essential service or 30 days in all other cases, and the  rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice subject to  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this subsection. However, in the case of a  week-to-week tenancy, the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less  than seven days after delivery of the notice if the breach is not remedied.|(b)  If the breach is remediable by repairs, the payment of damages or otherwise and  if the landlord adequately remedies the breach before the date specified in the  notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate by reason of the breach.|(c)  If substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior  noncompliance of which notice was given recurs within six months, the tenant  may terminate the rental agreement upon at least 14 days’ written notice  specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental agreement.  However, in the case of a week-to-week tenancy, the tenant may terminate the  rental agreement upon at least seven days’ written notice specifying the breach  and date of termination of the rental agreement.|(2)  Except as provided in this chapter, the tenant may recover damages and obtain  injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the landlord with the rental  agreement or ORS 90.320 or 90.730. The tenant shall not be entitled to recover  damages for a landlord noncompliance with ORS 90.320 or 90.730 if the landlord  neither knew nor reasonably should have known of the condition that constituted  the noncompliance and:|(a)  The tenant knew or reasonably should have known of the condition and failed to  give actual notice to the landlord in a reasonable time prior to the occurrence  of the personal injury, damage to personal property, diminution in rental value  or other tenant loss resulting from the noncompliance; or|(b)  The condition was caused after the tenancy began by the deliberate or negligent  act or omission of someone other than the landlord or a person acting on behalf  of the landlord.|(3)  The remedy provided in subsection (2) of this section is in addition to any  right of the tenant arising under subsection (1) of this section.|(4)  The tenant may not terminate or recover damages under this section for a  condition caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant  or other person on the premises with the tenant’s permission or consent.|(5)  If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all security  deposits and prepaid rent recoverable by the tenant under ORS 90.300. |[Formerly  91.800; 1993 c.369 §8; 1995 c.559 §20; 1997 c.577 §19; 1999 c.603 §21; 1999  c.676 §13]|90.365  Failure of landlord to supply essential services; remedies. (1) If contrary  to the rental agreement or ORS 90.320 or 90.730 the landlord intentionally or  negligently fails to supply any essential service, the tenant may give written  notice to the landlord specifying the breach and that the tenant may seek  substitute services, diminution in rent damages or substitute housing. After  allowing the landlord a reasonable time and reasonable access under the  circumstances to supply the essential service, the tenant may:|(a)  Procure reasonable amounts of the essential service during the period of the  landlord’s noncompliance and deduct their actual and reasonable cost from the  rent;|(b)  Recover damages based upon the diminution in the fair rental value of the  dwelling unit; or|(c)  If the failure to supply an essential service makes the dwelling unit unsafe or  unfit to occupy, procure substitute housing during the period of the landlord’s  noncompliance, in which case the tenant is excused from paying rent for the  period of the landlord’s noncompliance. In addition, the tenant may recover as  damages from the landlord the actual and reasonable cost or fair and reasonable  value of comparable substitute housing in excess of the rent for the dwelling  unit. For purposes of this paragraph, substitute housing is comparable if it is  of a quality that is similar to or less than the quality of the dwelling unit  with regard to basic elements including cooking and refrigeration services and,  if warranted, upon consideration of factors such as location in the same area  as the dwelling unit, the availability of substitute housing in the area and  the expense relative to the range of choices for substitute housing in the  area. A tenant may choose substitute housing of relatively greater quality, but  the tenant’s damages shall be limited to the cost or value of comparable  substitute housing.|(2)  If contrary to the rental agreement or ORS 90.320 or 90.730 the landlord fails  to supply any essential service, the lack of which poses an imminent and  serious threat to the tenant’s health, safety or property, the tenant may give  written notice to the landlord specifying the breach and that the rental agreement  shall terminate in not less than 48 hours unless the breach is remedied within  that period. If the landlord adequately remedies the breach before the end of  the notice period, the rental agreement shall not terminate by reason of the  breach. As used in this subsection, "imminent and serious threat to the tenant’s  health, safety or property" shall not include the presence of radon, asbestos  or lead-based paint or the future risk of flooding or seismic hazard, as  defined by ORS 455.447.|(3)  For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, a landlord shall not be  considered to be intentionally or negligently failing to supply an essential  service if:|(a)  The landlord substantially supplies the essential service; or|(b)  The landlord is making a reasonable and good faith effort to supply the  essential service and the failure is due to conditions beyond the landlord’s  control.|(4)  This section does not require a landlord to supply a cooking appliance or a  refrigerator if the landlord did not supply or agree to supply a cooking  appliance or refrigerator to the tenant.|(5)  If the tenant proceeds under this section, the tenant may not proceed under ORS  90.360 (1) as to that breach.|(6)  Rights of the tenant under this section do not arise if the condition was  caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant or a person  on the premises with the tenant’s consent.|(7)  Service or delivery of actual or written notice shall be as provided by ORS  90.150 and 90.155, including the addition of three days to the notice period if  written notice is delivered by first class mail.|(8)  Any provisions of this section that reasonably apply only to a structure that  is used as a home, residence or sleeping place does not apply to a manufactured  dwelling, recreational vehicle or floating home if the tenant owns the  manufactured dwelling, recreational vehicle or floating home and rents the  space. [Formerly 91.805; 1995 c.559 §21; 1997 c.577 §20; 1999 c.603 §22; 1999  c.676 §14; 2007 c.508 §8]|90.367  Application of security deposit or prepaid rent after notice of foreclosure;  termination of fixed term tenancy after notice. (1) A tenant who  receives actual notice that the property that is the subject of the tenant’s  rental agreement with a landlord is in foreclosure may apply the tenant’s  security deposit or prepaid rent to the tenant’s obligation to the landlord.  The tenant must notify the landlord in writing that the tenant intends to do  so. The giving of the notice provided by this subsection by the tenant does not  constitute a termination of the tenancy.|(2)  A landlord may not terminate the tenancy of a tenant:|(a)  Because the tenant has applied the security deposit or prepaid rent as allowed  under subsection (1) of this section.|(b)  For nonpayment of rent during the month in which the tenant applies the  security deposit or prepaid rent pursuant to subsection (1) of this section  unless an unpaid balance remains due after applying all payments, including the  security deposit or prepaid rent, to the rent.|(3)  If the tenant has not provided the written notice applying the security deposit  or prepaid rent as required under subsection (1) of this section before the  landlord gives a termination notice for nonpayment of rent, the tenant must  provide the written notice within the notice period provided by ORS 90.392 or  90.394. If the tenant does not provide the written notice, the landlord may  terminate the tenancy based upon ORS 90.392 or 90.394.|(4)  Application of the security deposit or prepaid rent pursuant to subsection (1)  of this section to an obligation owed to the landlord does not constitute a  partial payment under ORS 90.417.|(5)  If the landlord provides written evidence from a lender or trustee that the  property is no longer in foreclosure, the landlord may require the tenant to  restore the security deposit or prepaid rent to the amount required prior to  the tenant’s application of the security deposit or prepaid rent. The landlord  shall allow the tenant at least two months to restore the security deposit or  prepaid rent.|(6)|(a)  A tenant with a fixed term tenancy who receives actual notice that the property  that is the subject of the tenant’s rental agreement with a landlord is in  foreclosure may terminate the tenancy by delivering a written notice to the  landlord specifying that the tenant has received notice that the property is in  foreclosure and that the tenancy will terminate upon a designated date that is  not less than 60 days after delivery of the notice unless within 30 days the  landlord provides the tenant with written evidence from a lender or trustee  that the property is no longer in foreclosure or with written evidence that a  receiver has been appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to oversee the  operation of the property.|(b)  If the landlord does not provide the tenant with written evidence as described  in paragraph (a) of this subsection within the 30-day period after delivery of  the notice of termination, the tenancy terminates as provided in the notice. |[2009  c.510 §4; 2011 c.42 §7a; 2013 c.294 §10]|90.368  Repair of minor habitability defect. (1) As used in this section, "minor  habitability defect":|(a)  Means a defect that may reasonably be repaired for not more than $300, such as  the repair of leaky plumbing, stopped up toilets or faulty light switches.|(b)  Does not mean the presence of mold, radon, asbestos or lead-based paint.|(2)  If, contrary to ORS 90.320, the landlord fails to repair a minor habitability  defect, the tenant may cause the repair of the defect and deduct from the  tenant’s subsequent rent obligation the actual and reasonable cost of the repair  work, not to exceed $300.|(3)|(a)  Prior to causing a repair under subsection (2) of this section, the tenant  shall give the landlord written notice:|(A)  Describing the minor habitability defect; and|(B)  Stating the tenant’s intention to cause the repair of the defect and deduct the  cost of the repair from a subsequent rent obligation if the landlord fails to  make the repair by a specified date.|(b)  The specified date for repair contained in a written notice given to a landlord  under this subsection must be at least seven days after the date the notice is  given to the landlord.|(c)  If the landlord fails to make the repair by the specified date, the tenant may  use the remedy provided by subsection (2) of this section.|(d)  Service or delivery of the required written notice shall be made as provided  under ORS 90.155.|(4)|(a)  Any repair work performed under this section must be performed in a workmanlike  manner and be in compliance with state statutes, local ordinances and the state  building code.|(b)  The landlord may specify the people to perform the repair work if the landlord’s  specifications are reasonable and do not diminish the tenant’s rights under  this section.|(c)  The tenant may not perform work to repair the defect.|(d)  To deduct the repair cost from the rent, the tenant must provide to the  landlord a written statement, prepared by the person who made the repair,  showing the actual cost of the repair.|(5)  A tenant may not cause the repair of a defect under this section if:|(a)  Within the time specified in the notice, the landlord substantially repairs the  defect;|(b)  After the time specified in the notice, but before the tenant causes the repair  to be made, the landlord substantially repairs the defect;|(c)  The tenant has prevented the landlord from making the repair;|(d)  The defect was caused by a deliberate or negligent act or omission of the  tenant or of a person on the premises with the tenant’s consent;|(e)  The tenant knew of the defect for more than six months before giving notice under  this section; or|(f)  The tenant has previously used the remedy provided by this section for the same  occurrence of the defect.|(6)  If the tenant proceeds under this section, the tenant may not proceed under ORS  90.360 (1) as to that breach, but may use any other available remedy in  addition to the remedy provided by this section. [2007 c.508 §2]|90.370  Tenant counterclaims in action by landlord for possession or rent. (1)(a) In an  action for possession based upon nonpayment of the rent or in an action for  rent when the tenant is in possession, the tenant may counterclaim for any  amount, not in excess of the jurisdictional limits of the court in which the  action is brought, that the tenant may recover under the rental agreement or  this chapter, provided that the tenant must prove that prior to the filing of  the landlord’s action the landlord reasonably had or should have had knowledge  or had received actual notice of the facts that constitute the tenant’s  counterclaim.|(b)  In the event the tenant counterclaims, the court at the landlord’s or tenant’s  request may order the tenant to pay into court all or part of the rent accrued  and thereafter accruing, and shall determine the amount due to each party. The  party to whom a net amount is owed shall be paid first from the money paid into  court, and shall be paid the balance by the other party. The court may at any  time release money paid into court to either party if the parties agree or if  the court finds such party to be entitled to the sum so released. If no rent  remains due after application of this section and unless otherwise agreed  between the parties, a judgment shall be entered for the tenant in the action  for possession.|(2)  In an action for rent when the tenant is not in possession, the tenant may  counterclaim as provided in subsection (1) of this section but is not required  to pay any rent into court.|(3)  If the tenant does not comply with an order to pay rent into the court as  provided in subsection (1) of this section, the tenant shall not be permitted  to assert a counterclaim in the action for possession.|(4)  If the total amount found due to the tenant on any counterclaims is less than  any rent found due to the landlord, and the tenant retains possession solely  because the tenant paid rent into court under subsection (1) of this section,  no attorney fees shall be awarded to the tenant unless the tenant paid at least  the balance found due to the landlord into court no later than the commencement  of the trial.|(5)  When a tenant is granted a continuance for a longer period than two days, and  has not been ordered to pay rent into court under subsection (1) of this  section, the tenant shall be ordered to pay rent into court under ORS 105.140  (2). [Formerly 91.810; 1993 c.369 §9; 1995 c.559 §22]|90.375  Effect of unlawful ouster or exclusion; willful diminution of services. If a landlord  unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises, seriously attempts  or seriously threatens unlawfully to remove or exclude the tenant from the  premises or willfully diminishes or seriously attempts or seriously threatens  unlawfully to diminish services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the  interruption of heat, running water, hot water, electric or other essential  service, the tenant may obtain injunctive relief to recover possession or may  terminate the rental agreement and recover an amount up to two months’ periodic  rent or twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant, whichever is greater.  If the rental agreement is terminated the landlord shall return all security  deposits and prepaid rent recoverable under ORS 90.300. The tenant need not  terminate the rental agreement, obtain injunctive relief or recover possession  to recover damages under this section. |[Formerly 91.815; 1993 c.369 §10; 1995  c.559 §23; 1997 c.577 §21]|90.380  Effect of rental of dwelling in violation of building or housing codes; remedy. (1) As used in  this section, "posted" means that a governmental agency has attached a copy of  the agency’s written determination in a secure manner to the main entrance of  the dwelling unit or to the premises or building of which the dwelling unit is  a part.|(2)|(a)  If a governmental agency has posted a dwelling unit as unsafe and unlawful to  occupy due to the existence of conditions that violate state or local law and  materially affect health or safety to an extent that, in the agency’s  determination, the tenant must vacate the unit and another person may not take  possession of the unit, a landlord may not continue a tenancy or enter into a  new tenancy for the dwelling unit until the landlord corrects the conditions  that led to the agency’s determination.|(b)  If a landlord knowingly violates paragraph (a) of this subsection, the tenant  may immediately terminate the tenancy by giving the landlord actual notice of  the termination and the reason for the termination and may recover from the  landlord either two months’ periodic rent or up to twice the actual damages  sustained by the tenant as a result of the violation, whichever is greater. The  tenant need not terminate the tenancy to recover damages under this section.|(3)|(a)  If a governmental agency has given a written notice to a landlord that a  dwelling unit has been determined to be unlawful, but not unsafe, to occupy due  to the existence of conditions that violate state or local law and materially  affect health or safety to an extent that, in the agency’s determination,  although the unit is safe for an existing tenant to occupy, another person may  not take possession of the unit, the landlord may not enter into a new tenancy  for the dwelling unit until the landlord corrects the conditions that led to  the agency’s determination.|(b)  If a landlord knowingly violates paragraph (a) of this subsection, the tenant  may recover from the landlord either two months’ periodic rent or up to twice  the actual damages sustained by the tenant as a result of the violation,  whichever is greater.|(c)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this subsection, a landlord is not liable to a  tenant for a violation of paragraph (a) of this subsection if, prior to the  commencement of the tenancy, the landlord discloses to the tenant that the  dwelling unit has been determined to be unlawful to occupy.|(d)  A disclosure described in paragraph (c) of this subsection must be in writing,  include a description of the conditions that led to the agency’s determination  and state that the landlord is obligated to correct the conditions before  entering into a new tenancy. The landlord shall attach a copy of the agency’s  notice to the disclosure. The notice copy may provide the information required  by this paragraph to be disclosed by the landlord to the tenant.|(e)  A disclosure described in paragraph (c) of this subsection does not release the  landlord from the duties imposed by this chapter, including the duty to  maintain the dwelling unit in a habitable condition pursuant to ORS 90.320 or  90.730. A tenant who enters into a tenancy after the landlord’s disclosure does  not waive the tenant’s other remedies under this chapter. The disclosure does  not prevent the governmental agency that made the determination from imposing  on the landlord any penalty authorized by law for entering into the new  tenancy.|(4)|(a)  If a governmental agency has made a determination regarding a dwelling unit and  has posted or given notice for conditions described in subsection (2)(a) or  (3)(a) of this section, a landlord may not accept from an applicant for that  dwelling unit a deposit to secure the execution of a rental agreement pursuant  to ORS 90.297 unless, before accepting the deposit, the landlord discloses to  the applicant as provided by subsection (3)(c) of this section that the  dwelling unit has been determined to be unlawful to occupy.|(b)  If a landlord knowingly violates paragraph (a) of this subsection or fails to  correct the conditions leading to the agency’s determination before the date a  new tenancy is to begin as provided by the agreement to secure the execution of  a rental agreement, an applicant may terminate the agreement to secure the execution  of the rental agreement by giving the landlord actual notice of the termination  and the reason for termination. As a result of a termination, the applicant may  recover from the landlord an amount equal to twice the deposit. If an applicant  recovers damages for a violation pursuant to this paragraph, the applicant may  not recover any amounts under ORS 90.297.|(5)  If, after a landlord and a tenant have entered into a tenancy, a governmental  agency posts a dwelling unit as unsafe and unlawful to occupy due to the  existence of conditions that violate state or local law, that materially affect  health or safety and that:|(a)  Were not caused by the tenant, the tenant may immediately terminate the tenancy  by giving the landlord actual notice of the termination and the reason for the  termination; or|(b)  Were not caused by the landlord or by the landlord’s failure to maintain the  dwelling, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving the tenant 24 hours’  written notice of the termination and the reason for the termination, after  which the landlord may take possession in the manner provided in ORS 105.105 to  105.168.|(6)  If the tenancy is terminated, as a result of conditions as described in  subsections (2), (4) and (5) of this section, within 14 days of the notice of  termination the landlord shall return to the applicant or tenant:|(a)  All of the deposit to secure the execution of a rental agreement, security  deposit or prepaid rent owed to the applicant under this section or to the  tenant under ORS 90.300; and|(b)  All rent prepaid for the month in which the termination occurs, prorated, if  applicable, to the date of termination or the date the tenant vacates the  premises, whichever is later.|(7)  If conditions at premises that existed at the outset of the tenancy and that  were not caused by the tenant pose an imminent and serious threat to the health  or safety of occupants of the premises within six months from the beginning of  the tenancy, the tenant may immediately terminate the rental agreement by  giving the landlord actual notice of the termination and the reason for the  termination. In addition, if the landlord knew or should have reasonably known  of the existence of the conditions, the tenant may recover either two months’  periodic rent or twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant as a result  of the violation, whichever is greater. The tenant need not terminate the  rental agreement to recover damages under this section. Within four days of the  tenant’s notice of termination, the landlord shall return to the tenant:|(a)  All of the security deposit or prepaid rent owed to the tenant under ORS  90.300; and|(b)  All rent prepaid for the month in which the termination occurs, prorated to the  date of termination or the date the tenant vacates the premises, whichever is  later.|(8)|(a)  A landlord shall return the money due the applicant or tenant under subsections  (6) and (7) of this section either by making the money available to the  applicant or tenant at the landlord’s customary place of business or by mailing  the money by first class mail to the applicant or tenant.|(b)  The applicant or tenant has the option of choosing the method for return of any  money due under this section. If the applicant or tenant fails to choose one of  these methods at the time of giving the notice of termination, the landlord  shall use the mail method, addressed to the last-known address of the applicant  or tenant and mailed within the relevant four-day or 14-day period following  the applicant’s or tenant’s notice.|(9)  If the landlord fails to comply with subsection (8) of this section, the  applicant or tenant may recover the money due in an amount equal to twice the  amount due. |[Formerly 91.817; 1993 c.369 §11; 1995 c.559 §24; 2001 c.596 §32]|90.385  Retaliatory conduct by landlord; tenant remedies and defenses; action for  possession in certain cases. (1) Except as provided in this section, a  landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services, by  serving a notice to terminate the tenancy or by bringing or threatening to  bring an action for possession after:|(a)  The tenant has complained to, or expressed to the landlord in writing an  intention to complain to, a governmental agency charged with responsibility for  enforcement of any of the following concerning a violation applicable to the  tenancy:|(A)  A building, health or housing code materially affecting health or safety;|(B)  Laws or regulations concerning the delivery of mail; or|(C)  Laws or regulations prohibiting discrimination in rental housing;|(b)  The tenant has made any complaint to the landlord that is in good faith and  related to the tenancy;|(c)  The tenant has organized or become a member of a tenants’ union or similar  organization;|(d)  The tenant has testified against the landlord in any judicial, administrative  or legislative proceeding;|(e)  The tenant successfully defended an action for possession brought by the  landlord within the previous six months except if the tenant was successful in  defending the action only because:|(A)  The termination notice by the landlord was not served or delivered in the  manner required by ORS 90.155; or|(B)  The period provided by the termination notice was less than that required by  the statute upon which the notice relied to terminate the tenancy; or|(f)  The tenant has performed or expressed intent to perform any other act for the  purpose of asserting, protecting or invoking the protection of any right  secured to tenants under any federal, state or local law.|(2)  As used in subsection (1) of this section, "decreasing services" includes:|(a)  Unreasonably restricting the availability of or placing unreasonable burdens on  the use of common areas or facilities by tenant associations or tenants meeting  to establish a tenant organization; and|(b)  Intentionally and unreasonably interfering with and substantially impairing the  enjoyment or use of the premises by the tenant.|(3)  If the landlord acts in violation of subsection (1) of this section the tenant  is entitled to the remedies provided in ORS 90.375 and has a defense in any  retaliatory action against the tenant for possession.|(4)  Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (3) of this section, a landlord may bring  an action for possession if:|(a)  The complaint by the tenant was made to the landlord or an agent of the  landlord in an unreasonable manner or at an unreasonable time or was repeated  in a manner having the effect of unreasonably harassing the landlord. A  determination whether the manner, time or effect of a complaint was  unreasonable shall include consideration of all related circumstances preceding  or contemporaneous to the complaint;|(b)  The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily  by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in the household of  the tenant or upon the premises with the consent of the tenant;|(c)  The tenant was in default in rent at the time of the service of the notice upon  which the action is based; or|(d)  Compliance with the applicable building or housing code requires alteration,  remodeling or demolition which would effectively deprive the tenant of use of  the dwelling unit.|(5)  For purposes of this section, a complaint made by another on behalf of a tenant  is considered a complaint by the tenant.|(6)  For the purposes of subsection (4)(c) of this section, a tenant who has paid  rent into court pursuant to ORS 90.370 shall not be considered to be in default  in rent.|(7)  The maintenance of an action under subsection (4) of this section does not  release the landlord from liability under ORS 90.360 (2). |[Formerly 91.865;  1995 c.559 §25; 1997 c.303 §1; 1999 c.603 §23; 2011 c.42 §8]|90.390  Discrimination against tenant or applicant; tenant defense.

See Preface to Oregon Revised Statutes for further  explanation.|90.392  Termination of tenancy for cause; tenant right to cure violation. (1) Except as  provided in this chapter, after delivery of written notice a landlord may  terminate the rental agreement for cause and take possession as provided in ORS  105.105 to 105.168, unless the tenant cures the violation as provided in this  section.|(2)  Causes for termination under this section are:|(a)  Material violation by the tenant of the rental agreement. For purposes of this  paragraph, material violation of the rental agreement includes, but is not  limited to, the nonpayment of a late charge under ORS 90.260 or a utility or  service charge under ORS 90.315.|(b)  Material violation by the tenant of ORS 90.325.|(c)  Failure by the tenant to pay rent.|(3)  The notice must:|(a)  Specify the acts and omissions constituting the violation;|(b)  Except as provided in subsection (5)(a) of this section, state that the rental  agreement will terminate upon a designated date not less than 30 days after  delivery of the notice; and|(c)  If the tenant can cure the violation as provided in subsection (4) of this  section, state that the violation can be cured, describe at least one possible  remedy to cure the violation and designate the date by which the tenant must  cure the violation.|(4)|(a)  If the violation described in the notice can be cured by the tenant by a change  in conduct, repairs, payment of money or otherwise, the rental agreement does  not terminate if the tenant cures the violation by the designated date. The  designated date must be:|(A)  At least 14 days after delivery of the notice; or|(B)  If the violation is conduct that was a separate and distinct act or omission  and is not ongoing, no earlier than the date of delivery of the notice as  provided in ORS 90.155. For purposes of this paragraph, conduct is ongoing if  the conduct is constant or persistent or has been sufficiently repetitive over  time that a reasonable person would consider the conduct to be ongoing.|(b)  If the tenant does not cure the violation, the rental agreement terminates as  provided in the notice.|(5)|(a)  If the cause of a written notice delivered under subsection (1) of this section  is substantially the same act or omission that constituted a prior violation  for which notice was given under this section within the previous six months,  the designated termination date stated in the notice must be not less than 10  days after delivery of the notice and no earlier than the designated  termination date stated in the previously given notice. The tenant does not  have a right to cure this subsequent violation.|(b)  A landlord may not terminate a rental agreement under this subsection if the  only violation is a failure to pay the current month’s rent.|(6)  When a tenancy is a week-to-week tenancy, the notice period in:|(a)  Subsection (3)(b) of this section changes from 30 days to seven days;|(b)  Subsection (4)(a)(A) of this section changes from 14 days to four days; and|(c)  Subsection (5)(a) of this section changes from 10 days to four days.|(7)  The termination of a tenancy for a manufactured dwelling or floating home space  in a facility under ORS 90.505 to 90.850 is governed by ORS 90.630 and not by  this section. [2005 c.391 §7]|90.394  Termination of tenancy for failure to pay rent. The landlord may  terminate the rental agreement for nonpayment of rent and take possession as  provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168, as follows:|(1)  When the tenancy is a week-to-week tenancy, by delivering to the tenant at  least 72 hours’ written notice of nonpayment and the landlord’s intention to  terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period. The  landlord shall give this notice no sooner than on the fifth day of the rental  period, including the first day the rent is due.|(2)  For all tenancies other than week-to-week tenancies, by delivering to the  tenant:|(a)  At least 72 hours’ written notice of nonpayment and the landlord’s intention to  terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period. The  landlord shall give this notice no sooner than on the eighth day of the rental  period, including the first day the rent is due; or|(b)  At least 144 hours’ written notice of nonpayment and the landlord’s intention  to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period.  The landlord shall give this notice no sooner than on the fifth day of the  rental period, including the first day the rent is due.|(3)  The notice described in this section must also specify the amount of rent that  must be paid and the date and time by which the tenant must pay the rent to  cure the nonpayment of rent.|(4)  Payment by a tenant who has received a notice under this section is timely if  mailed to the landlord within the period of the notice unless:|(a)  The notice is served on the tenant:|(A)  By personal delivery as provided in ORS 90.155 (1)(a); or|(B)  By first class mail and attachment as provided in ORS 90.155 (1)(c);|(b)  A written rental agreement and the notice expressly state that payment is to be  made at a specified location that is either on the premises or at a place where  the tenant has made all previous rent payments in person; and|(c)  The place so specified is available to the tenant for payment throughout the  period of the notice. [2005 c.391 §8]|90.396  Acts or omissions justifying termination 24 hours after notice. (1) Except as  provided in subsection (2) of this section, after at least 24 hours’ written  notice specifying the acts and omissions constituting the cause and specifying  the date and time of the termination, the landlord may terminate the rental  agreement and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168, if:|(a)  The tenant, someone in the tenant’s control or the tenant’s pet seriously  threatens to inflict substantial personal injury, or inflicts any substantial  personal injury, upon a person on the premises other than the tenant;|(b)  The tenant or someone in the tenant’s control recklessly endangers a person on  the premises other than the tenant by creating a serious risk of substantial  personal injury;|(c)  The tenant, someone in the tenant’s control or the tenant’s pet inflicts any  substantial personal injury upon a neighbor living in the immediate vicinity of  the premises;|(d)  The tenant or someone in the tenant’s control intentionally inflicts any  substantial damage to the premises or the tenant’s pet inflicts substantial  damage to the premises on more than one occasion;|(e)|(A)  The tenant intentionally provided substantial false information on the  application for the tenancy within the past year;|(B)  The false information was with regard to a criminal conviction of the tenant  that would have been material to the landlord’s acceptance of the application;  and|(C)  The landlord terminates the rental agreement within 30 days after discovering  the falsity of the information; or|(f)  The tenant, someone in the tenant’s control or the tenant’s pet commits any act  that is outrageous in the extreme, on the premises or in the immediate vicinity  of the premises. For purposes of this paragraph, an act is outrageous in the  extreme if the act is not described in paragraphs (a) to (e) of this  subsection, but is similar in degree and is one that a reasonable person in  that community would consider to be so offensive as to warrant termination of  the tenancy within 24 hours, considering the seriousness of the act or the risk  to others. An act that is outrageous in the extreme is more extreme or serious  than an act that warrants a 30-day termination under ORS 90.392. Acts that are "outrageous  in the extreme" include, but are not limited to, the following acts by a  person:|(A)  Prostitution, commercial sexual solicitation or promoting prostitution, as  described in ORS 167.007, 167.008 and 167.012;|(B)  Unlawful manufacture, delivery or possession of a controlled substance, as  defined in ORS 475.005;|(C)  Manufacture of a cannabinoid extract, as defined in ORS 475B.015, unless the  person manufacturing the cannabinoid extract holds a license issued under ORS  475B.090 or is registered under ORS 475B.840;|(D)  A bias crime, as described in ORS 166.155 and 166.165; or|(E)  Burglary as described in ORS 164.215 and 164.225.|(2)  If the cause for a termination notice given pursuant to subsection (1) of this  section is based upon the acts of the tenant’s pet, the tenant may cure the  cause and avoid termination of the tenancy by removing the pet from the  premises prior to the end of the notice period. The notice must describe the  right of the tenant to cure the cause. If the tenant returns the pet to the  premises at any time after having cured the violation, the landlord, after at  least 24 hours’ written notice specifying the subsequent presence of the  offending pet, may terminate the rental agreement and take possession as  provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. The tenant does not have a right to cure  this subsequent violation.|(3)  For purposes of subsection (1) of this section, someone is in the tenant’s  control if that person enters or remains on the premises with the tenant’s  permission or consent after the tenant reasonably knows or should know of that  person’s act or likelihood to commit any act of the type described in  subsection (1) of this section.|(4)  An act can be proven to be outrageous in the extreme even if the act is one  that does not violate a criminal statute. Notwithstanding the references to  criminal statutes in subsection (1)(f) of this section, the landlord’s burden  of proof in an action for possession under subsection (1) of this section is  the civil standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence.|(5)  If a good faith effort by a landlord to terminate the tenancy under subsection  (1)(f) of this section and to recover possession of the rental unit under ORS  105.105 to 105.168 fails by decision of the court, the landlord may not be  found in violation of any state statute or local ordinance requiring the  landlord to remove that tenant upon threat of fine, abatement or forfeiture as  long as the landlord continues to make a good faith effort to terminate the  tenancy.

(1) If a tenant  living for less than two years in drug and alcohol free housing uses, possesses  or shares alcohol, marijuana items as defined in ORS 475B.015, illegal drugs,  controlled substances or prescription drugs without a medical prescription, the  landlord may deliver a written notice to the tenant terminating the tenancy for  cause and take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168. The notice  must specify the acts constituting the drug or alcohol violation and state that  the rental agreement will terminate in not less than 48 hours after delivery of  the notice, at a specified date and time. The notice must also state that the  tenant can cure the drug or alcohol violation by a change in conduct or  otherwise within 24 hours after delivery of the notice.|(2)  If the tenant cures the violation within the 24-hour period, the rental  agreement does not terminate. If the tenant does not cure the violation within  the 24-hour period, the rental agreement terminates as provided in the notice.|(3)  If substantially the same act that constituted a prior drug or alcohol  violation of which notice was given reoccurs within six months, the landlord  may terminate the rental agreement upon at least 24 hours’ written notice  specifying the violation and the date and time of termination of the rental  agreement. The tenant does not have a right to cure this subsequent violation.

(1) If an  unauthorized person is in possession of the premises, after at least 24 hours’  written notice specifying the cause and the date and time by which the person  must vacate, a landlord may take possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to  105.168 if:|(a)  The tenant has vacated the premises;|(b)  The rental agreement with the tenant prohibited subleasing or allowing another  person to occupy the premises without the written permission of the landlord;  and|(c)  The landlord has not knowingly accepted rent from the person in possession of  the premises.|(2)  Service of notice under this section does not create a right of tenancy for the  person in possession of the premises. |[2005 c.391 §12]|90.405  Effect of tenant keeping unpermitted pet. (1) If the tenant, in violation of  the rental agreement, keeps on the premises a pet capable of causing damage to  persons or property, the landlord may deliver a written notice specifying the  violation and stating that the tenancy will terminate upon a date not less than  10 days after the delivery of the notice unless the tenant removes the pet from  the premises prior to the termination date specified in the notice. If the pet  is not removed by the date specified, the tenancy shall terminate and the  landlord may take possession in the manner provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168.|(2)  For purposes of this section, "a pet capable of causing damage to persons or  property" means an animal that, because of the nature, size or behavioral  characteristics of that particular animal or of that breed or type of animal  generally, a reasonable person might consider to be capable of causing personal  injury or property damage, including but not limited to, water damage from  medium or larger sized fish tanks or other personal injury or property damage  arising from the environment in which the animal is kept.|(3)  If substantially the same act that constituted a prior noncompliance of which  notice was given under subsection (1) of this section recurs within six months,  the landlord may terminate the rental agreement upon at least 10 days’ written  notice specifying the breach and the date of termination of the rental  agreement.|(4)  This section shall not apply to any tenancy governed by ORS 90.505 to 90.850.

(1) If the rental  agreement requires the tenant to give actual notice to the landlord of an  anticipated extended absence in excess of seven days as permitted by ORS 90.340  and the tenant willfully fails to do so, the landlord may recover actual  damages from the tenant.|(2)  During any absence of the tenant in excess of seven days, the landlord may  enter the dwelling unit at times reasonably necessary.|(3)  If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make reasonable  efforts to rent it for a fair rental. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit  for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, the rental  agreement terminates as of the date of the new tenancy. If the landlord fails  to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental or if the  landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender, the rental agreement is deemed  to be terminated by the landlord as of the date the landlord knows or should  know of the abandonment. If the tenancy is from month to month or week to week,  the term of the rental agreement for this purpose is deemed to be a month or a  week, as the case may be.

A landlord may refuse to accept a rent tender  that is for less than the full amount of rent owed or that is untimely.|(2)  A landlord may accept a partial payment of rent. The acceptance of a partial  payment of rent in a manner consistent with subsection (4) of this section does  not constitute a waiver under ORS 90.412 (2)(b) of the landlord’s right to  terminate the tenancy under ORS 90.394 for nonpayment of the balance of the  rent owed.|(3)  A landlord and tenant may by written agreement provide that monthly rent shall  be paid in regular installments of less than a month pursuant to a schedule  specified in the agreement. Installment rent payments described in this  subsection are not partial payment of rent for purposes of this section.|(4)  The acceptance of a partial payment of rent waives the right of the landlord to  terminate the tenant’s rental agreement under ORS 90.394 for nonpayment of rent  unless:|(a)|(A)  The landlord accepted the partial payment of rent before the landlord gave a  nonpayment of rent termination notice under ORS 90.394 based on the tenant’s  agreement to pay the balance by a time certain and the tenant does not pay the  balance of the rent as agreed;|(B)  The landlord’s notice of termination is served no earlier than it would have  been permitted under ORS 90.394 had no rent been accepted; and|(C)  The notice permits the tenant to avoid termination of the tenancy for  nonpayment of rent by paying the balance within 72 hours or 144 hours, as the  case may be, or by any date to which the parties agreed, whichever is later; or|(b)  The landlord accepted a partial payment of rent after giving a nonpayment of  rent termination notice under ORS 90.394 and entered into a written agreement  with the tenant that the acceptance does not constitute waiver. The agreement  may provide that the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and take  possession as provided in ORS 105.105 to 105.168 without serving a new notice  under ORS 90.394 if the tenant fails to pay the balance of the rent by a time  certain.|(5)  Application of a tenant’s security deposit or prepaid rent to an obligation  owed to a landlord in foreclosure under ORS 90.367 does not constitute a  partial payment of rent.|(6)  Notwithstanding any acceptance of a partial payment of rent under subsection  (4) of this section, the tenant continues to owe the landlord the unpaid  balance of the rent. |[2007 c.906 §29; 2011 c.42 §8a]|90.420  Enforceability of landlord liens; distraint for rent abolished.

A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal  property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but  does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.|(b)  The lienholder’s right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the  tenant, owner or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal  representative, designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the  dwelling or home within the allotted time.|(c)  To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition  to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a)  of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage  agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to  the lienholder.

A storage  charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.562, if  limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if  incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due  more frequently than monthly;|(B)  The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by  the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no  greater than for late charges described in the rental agreement between the  landlord and the tenant; and|(C)  The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the  personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and  obligations described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the  tenant.|(e)  During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder  has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the  lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave  the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions  previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord’s  approval of a purchaser or, if there was no such agreement, any reasonable  conditions by the landlord regarding approval of any purchaser who wishes to  leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant. The  landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the  property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.|(f)|(A)  If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate  the agreement by giving at least 90 days’ written notice to the lienholder  stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the  termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice  period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or  dispose of the dwelling or home without further notice to the lienholder.|(B)  After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of  this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the  lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage  agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may  terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the  lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for  termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice  period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or  dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.|(C)  A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14  days’ written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the  rented space if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges  as provided in the agreement.|(g)  Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided  by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties  otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the manufactured dwelling  or floating home, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to  this section without further notice to the lienholder.|(20)  If the personal property is a manufactured dwelling or floating home and is  considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the only  tenant and who owned the dwelling or home, this section applies, except as  follows:|(a)  The following persons have the same rights and responsibilities regarding the  abandoned dwelling or home as a tenant:|(A)  Any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for  the deceased tenant.|(B)  Any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord  in the event of the tenant’s death.|(b)  The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:|(A)  Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and|(B)  Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative  or designated person, if actually known to the landlord.|(c)  The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any  personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant,  and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.|(d)  If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to  possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual  notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of  this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage  agreement with the representative or person providing that the dwelling or home  may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or until  conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage agreement  entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the  previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle  anyone to occupy the personal property.

A storage charge may not be due  more frequently than monthly;|(B)  The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by  the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no  greater than for late charges described in the rental agreement between the  landlord and the tenant; and|(C)  The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the  personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and  obligations described in the rental agreement between the landlord and the tenant.|(e)  During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder  has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the  lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave  the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any  conditions previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the  landlord’s approval of a purchaser or, if there was no such agreement, any  reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval of any purchaser who  wishes to leave the dwelling or home on the rented space and become a tenant.  The landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser of the  property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and maintenance costs.|(f)|(A)  If the lienholder violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate  the agreement by giving at least 90 days’ written notice to the lienholder  stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the  termination.

A storage agreement  entitles the representative or person to store the personal property on the  previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not entitle  anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is entered, the  landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder pursuant to  subsection (19) of this section until the agreement with the personal  representative or designated person ends.|(e)  If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter  into a storage agreement, subsection (19)(c), (d) and (f)(C) of this section  applies, with the representative or person having the rights and  responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.|(f)  During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this  subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the  dwelling or home, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or  devisee where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the dwelling or  home on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to any conditions  previously agreed to by the landlord and tenant regarding the landlord’s  approval for occupancy of a purchaser, heir or devisee or, if there was no such  agreement, any reasonable conditions by the landlord regarding approval for  occupancy of any purchaser, heir or devisee who wishes to leave the dwelling or  home on the rented space and become a tenant.

Unless the representative or  person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates  as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the dwelling or home  without further notice to the representative or person.|(h)  Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage  agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement,  unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or  removed the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the landlord may sell or  dispose of the property pursuant to this section without further notice to the  representative or person.|(21)  If the personal property is other than a manufactured dwelling or floating home  and is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a tenant who was the  only tenant and who owned the personal property, this section applies except as  follows:|(a)  The following persons have the same rights and responsibilities regarding the  abandoned personal property as a tenant:|(A)  An heir or devisee.|(B)  Any personal representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for  the deceased tenant.|(C)  Any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the landlord  in the event of the tenant’s death.|(b)  The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:|(A)  Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises;|(B)  Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any heir, devisee, personal  representative or designated person, if actually known to the landlord; and|(C)  Sent by first class mail to the attention of an estate administrator of the  State Treasurer.|(c)  The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to the heir,  devisee, personal representative, designated person or estate administrator of  the State Treasurer, instead of the deceased tenant, and must incorporate the  provisions of this subsection.|(d)  The landlord shall allow a person that is an heir, devisee or personal  representative of the tenant, or an estate administrator of the State  Treasurer, to remove the personal property if the person contacts the landlord  within the period provided by subsection (6) of this section, complies with the  requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable evidence  that the person is an heir, devisee or personal representative, or an estate administrator  of the State Treasurer.|(e)  If no heir, devisee or personal representative of the tenant, or no estate  administrator of the State Treasurer, contacts the landlord within the time  period provided by subsection (6) of this section, the landlord shall allow  removal of the personal property by the designated person of the tenant, if the  designated person contacts the landlord within that period and complies with  the requirements of this section and provides the landlord with reasonable  evidence that the person is the designated person.|(f)  A landlord who allows removal of personal property under this subsection is not  liable to another person that has a claim or interest in the personal property.|(22)  If a governmental agency determines that the condition of a manufactured  dwelling, floating home or recreational vehicle abandoned under this section  constitutes an extreme health or safety hazard under state or local law and the  agency determines that the hazard endangers others in the immediate vicinity  and requires quick removal of the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of  the property pursuant to this subsection.

The subleasing agreement shall require the renter to timely pay to the  facility landlord the space rent, any separately assessed fees payable under  the rental agreement and any separately billed utility or service charge  described in ORS 90.560 to 90.584. The subleasing agreement shall also grant  the renter the same rights as the facility tenant to cure a violation of the  rental agreement for the facility space, to require the facility landlord to  comply with ORS 90.730 and to be protected from retaliatory conduct under ORS  90.765. This subsection does not authorize a facility tenant to sublease to a  renter in violation of the rental agreement.|(3)  Notwithstanding ORS 90.100 (47), a facility tenant who enters into a subleasing  agreement remains the tenant of the facility space and retains all rights and  obligations under the rental agreement and this chapter. The occupancy by a  renter does not constitute abandonment of the dwelling or home by the facility  tenant.|(4)  The rights and obligations of the renter under a subleasing agreement are in  addition to the rights and obligations retained by the facility tenant under  subsection (3) of this section and any rights or obligations of the facility  tenant and renter under ORS 90.100 to 90.465.|(5)  Unless otherwise provided in the subleasing agreement, and without regard to  whether the facility landlord terminates the rental agreement, a facility  landlord may terminate a subleasing agreement:|(a)  Without cause by giving the renter written notice not less than 30 days prior  to the termination;|(b)  If a condition described in ORS 90.380 (5)(b) exists for the facility space, by  giving the renter the same notice to which the facility tenant is entitled  under ORS 90.380 (5)(b); or|(c)  Subject to the right to cure:|(A)  For nonpayment of facility space rent under ORS 90.394 or 90.630; or|(B)  For any conduct by the renter that would be a violation of the rental agreement  under ORS 90.396 or 90.398 if committed by the facility tenant.|(6)  Upon termination of a subleasing agreement by the facility landlord, whether  with or without cause, the renter and the facility tenant are excused from  continued performance under any subleasing agreement.|(7)|(a)  If, during the term of a subleasing agreement, the facility landlord gives  notice to the facility tenant of a rental agreement violation, a law or  ordinance violation or the facility’s closure, conversion or sale, the landlord  shall also promptly give a copy of the notice to the renter. The giving of  notice to the renter does not constitute notice to the facility tenant unless  the facility tenant has expressly appointed the renter as the facility tenant’s  agent for purposes of receiving notice.|(b)  If the facility landlord gives notice to the renter that the landlord is  terminating the subleasing agreement, the landlord shall also promptly give a  copy of the notice to the facility tenant by written notice.|(c)  If, during the term of a subleasing agreement, the facility tenant gives notice  to the facility landlord of a rental agreement violation, termination of  tenancy or sale of the manufactured dwelling or floating home, the facility  tenant shall also promptly give a copy of the notice to the renter.|(d)  If the renter gives notice to the facility landlord of a violation of ORS  90.730, the renter shall also promptly give a copy of the notice to the  facility tenant.|(8)  Before entering into a sublease agreement, the facility landlord may screen a  renter under ORS 90.303, but may not apply to the renter credit and conduct  screening criteria that is more restrictive than the landlord applies to  applicants for a tenancy of a dwelling or home that is either owned by the  landlord or on consignment with the landlord under ORS 90.680.|(9)  Notwithstanding subsection (2) of this section, if a facility landlord rents or  has a policy of renting manufactured dwellings or floating homes that are  listed for sale by the facility landlord, the facility landlord may not  prohibit the facility tenant from entering into a subleasing agreement while  the facility tenant actively markets for sale the facility tenant’s  manufactured dwelling or floating home. |[2007 c.831 §2; 2011 c.42 §12; 2013  c.443 §10; 2015 c.217 §8; 2019 c.268 §3; 2019 c.625 §55] (Utility  and Service Charges)|90.560  Definitions for ORS 90.560 to 90.584. As used in ORS 90.560 to 90.584:|(1)  "Direct billing" means a relationship between the tenant and the utility or  service provider in which:|(a)  The provider provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space,  including any utility or service line, and bills the tenant directly; and|(b)  The landlord does not act as a provider.|(2)  "Park specific billing" means a relationship between the manufactured dwelling  park landlord, tenant and utility or service provider in which:|(a)  The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;|(b)  The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space;  and|(c)  The landlord uses a billing method to fairly apportion the utility or service  as approved by a majority of the manufactured dwelling park tenants.|(3)  "Pro rata billing" means a relationship between the landlord, tenant and  utility or service provider in which:|(a)  The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;|(b)  The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space or  to a common area available to the tenant as part of the tenancy; and|(c)  The landlord bills the tenant for a utility or service charge separately from  the rent in an amount determined by apportioning on a pro rata basis the  provider’s charge to the landlord as measured by a master meter.|(4)  "Public service charge" has the meaning given the term in ORS 90.315.|(5)  "Rent-included billing" means a relationship between the landlord, tenant and  utility or service provider in which:|(a)  The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;|(b)  The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space or  to a common area available to the tenant as part of the tenancy; and|(c)  The landlord includes the cost of the utility or service in the tenant’s rent.|(6)  "Submeter" means a device owned or under the control of a landlord and used to  measure a utility or service actually provided to a tenant at the tenant’s  space.|(7)  "Submeter billing" means a relationship between the landlord, tenant and utility  or service provider in which:|(a)  The provider provides the utility or service to the landlord;|(b)  The landlord provides the utility or service directly to the tenant’s space;  and|(c)  The landlord uses a submeter to measure the utility or service actually  provided to the space and bills the tenant for a utility or service charge for  the amount provided.|(8)  "Utility or service" has the meaning given that term in ORS 90.315. [Formerly  90.531]|90.562  Utility and service charges; limits. (1) Subject to the policies of the  utility or service provider and ORS 90.560 to 90.584, a landlord may provide  for utilities or services to tenants by one or more of the following billing  methods:|(a)  Direct billing;|(b)  Rent-included billing;|(c)  Pro rata billing;|(d)  Submeter billing; and|(e)  Park specific billing.|(2)  A landlord may not use pro rata billing for garbage collection and disposal,  unless the pro rata apportionment is based upon the number and size of the  garbage receptacles used by the tenant.|(3)  To assess a tenant for a utility or service charge for any billing period using  pro rata billing, submeter billing or park specific billing, the landlord shall  give the tenant a written notice, including notice by electronic means if  allowed in the rental agreement’s description of the billing method, stating  the amount of the utility or service charge that the tenant is to pay the  landlord and the due date for making the payment. The due date may not be  before the date of service of the notice. The amount of the charge is  determined as described in ORS 90.568, 90.572 or 90.584.

Any public service charge included in the utility or  service charge under ORS 90.570 must be itemized separately.|(4)  A utility or service charge is not rent or a fee. Nonpayment of a utility or  service charge is not grounds for termination of a rental agreement for  nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394, but is grounds for termination of a rental  agreement for cause under ORS 90.630. A landlord may not give a notice of  termination of a rental agreement under ORS 90.630 for nonpayment of a utility  or service charge sooner than the eighth day, including the first day the  utility or service charge is due, after the landlord gives the tenant the  written notice stating the amount of the utility or service charge.|(5)  The landlord is responsible for maintaining the utility or service system,  including any submeter. After any installation or maintenance of the system or  submeter on a tenant’s space, the landlord shall restore the space to a  condition that is substantially the same as or better than the condition of the  space before the installation or maintenance.|(6)  A landlord may not assess a utility or service charge for water unless the  water is provided to the landlord by a:|(a)  Public utility as defined in ORS 757.005;|(b)  Municipal utility operating under ORS chapter 225;|(c)  People’s utility district organized under ORS chapter 261;|(d)  Cooperative organized under ORS chapter 62;|(e)  Domestic water supply district organized under ORS chapter 264; or|(f)  Water improvement district organized under ORS chapter 552.|(7)  A landlord that provides utilities or services only to tenants of the landlord  in compliance with ORS 90.560 to 90.584 is not a public utility for purposes of  ORS chapter 757.|(8)  The authority of a utility or service provider to apply policy regarding the  billing methods does not authorize the utility or service provider to dictate  either the amount billed to tenants or the rate at which tenants are billed  under ORS 90.560 to 90.584. [Formerly 90.532]|90.564  Charge for cable, satellite or Internet. (1) Notwithstanding ORS 90.568 (4) or  90.572 (3), a landlord may add an additional amount to a utility or service  charge billed to the tenant if:|(a)  The utility or service charge to which the additional amount is added is for  cable television, direct satellite or other video subscription services or for  Internet access or usage;|(b)  The additional amount is not more than 10 percent of the utility or service  charge billed to the tenant;|(c)  The total of the utility or service charge and the additional amount is less  than the typical periodic cost the tenant would incur if the tenant contracted  directly with the provider for the cable television, direct satellite or other  video subscription services or for Internet access or usage;|(d)  The written rental agreement providing for the utility or service charge  describes the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or  service charge; and|(e)  Any billing or notice from the landlord regarding the utility or service charge  lists the additional amount separately and distinctly from the utility or  service charge.|(2)  A landlord may not require a tenant to agree to the amendment of an existing  rental agreement, and may not terminate a tenant for refusing to agree to the  amendment of a rental agreement, if the amendment would obligate the tenant to  pay an additional amount for cable television, direct satellite or other video  subscription services or for Internet access or usage as provided under  subsection (1) of this section. |[Formerly 90.535]|90.566  Conversion to direct billing for garbage service. (1) A landlord  may unilaterally amend a rental agreement to convert the method of billing a  tenant for garbage collection and disposal from rent-included billing or pro  rata billing to a billing method in which the service provider:|(a)  Supplies garbage receptacles;|(b)  Collects and disposes of garbage; and|(c)|(A)  Bills the tenant directly; or|(B)  Bills the landlord, who then bills the tenant based upon the number and size of  the receptacles used by the tenant.|(2)  A landlord shall give a tenant not less than 180 days’ written notice before  converting a billing method under subsection (1) of this section.|(3)  If the cost of garbage service was included in the rent before the conversion  of a billing method under subsection (1) of this section, the landlord shall  reduce the tenant’s rent upon the first billing of the tenant under the new  billing method. The rent reduction may not be less than an amount reasonably  comparable to the amount of rent previously allocated for garbage collection  and disposal costs averaged over at least the preceding year. Before the  conversion occurs, the landlord shall provide the tenant with written  documentation from the service provider showing the landlord’s cost for the  garbage collection and disposal service provided to the facility during at  least the preceding year.|(4)  A landlord may not convert a billing method under subsection (1) of this  section less than one year after giving notice of a rent increase, unless the  rent increase is an automatic increase provided for in a fixed term rental  agreement entered into one year or more before the conversion. |[Formerly  90.533]|90.568  Pro rata billing; apportionment methods. (1) If allowed by a written rental  agreement, a landlord using pro rata billing may require a tenant to pay to the  landlord a utility or service charge that was billed by a utility or service  provider to the landlord for a utility or service provided directly to the  tenant’s space or to a common area available to the tenant as part of the  tenancy. A landlord may include in pro rata billing a public service charge  under ORS 90.570.|(2)|(a)  As used in this subsection, "occupied" means that a tenant resides in the  dwelling or home during each month for which the utility or service is billed.|(b)  A pro rata billing charge to tenants for the tenants’ spaces under this section  must be allocated among the tenants by a method that reasonably apportions the  cost among the affected tenants and that is described in the rental agreement.|(c)  Methods that reasonably apportion the cost among the tenants include, but are  not limited to, methods that divide the cost based on:|(A)  The number of occupied spaces in the facility;|(B)  The number of tenants or occupants in the dwelling or home compared with the  number of tenants or occupants in the facility, if there is a correlation with  consumption of the utility or service; or|(C)  The square footage in each dwelling, home or space compared with the total  square footage of occupied dwellings or homes in the facility or the square  footage of the facility, if there is a correlation with consumption of the  utility or service.|(3)  A utility or service charge to be assessed to a tenant for a common area must  be described in the written rental agreement separately and distinctly from the  utility or service charge for the tenant’s space.|(4)  A landlord may not:|(a)  Bill or collect more money from tenants for utilities or services than the  utility or service provider charges the landlord.|(b)  Increase the utility or service charge to the tenant by adding any costs of the  landlord, such as a handling or administrative charge. [Formerly 90.534]|90.570  Public service charge pro rata apportionment. A landlord, upon 60 days’ written  notice to a tenant, may unilaterally amend a rental agreement to require a  tenant to pay to the landlord, as part of the utility or service charge, a pro  rata proportion of any new or increased public service charge billed to the  landlord by a utility or service provider or a local government for a public  service provided directly or indirectly to the tenant’s dwelling unit or to the  facility common areas. |[2019 c.625 §41]|90.572  Submeter billing.  (1) If allowed by a written rental agreement, a landlord using submeter billing  may require a tenant to pay to the landlord a utility or service charge that  has been billed by a utility or service provider to the landlord for utility or  service provided directly to the tenant’s space as measured by a submeter.|(2)  A utility or service charge to be assessed to a tenant under this section may  consist of only:|(a)  The cost of the utility or service provided to the tenant’s space and under the  tenant’s control, as measured by the submeter, at a rate no greater than the  average rate billed to the landlord by the utility or service provider, not  including any base or service charge;|(b)  The cost of any sewer service for wastewater as a percentage of the tenant’s  water charge as measured by a submeter, if the utility or service provider  charges the landlord for sewer service as a percentage of water provided;|(c)  A pro rata portion of the cost of sewer service for storm water and wastewater  if the utility or service provider does not charge the landlord for sewer  service as a percentage of water provided;|(d)  A pro rata portion of any public service charge assessed to the landlord under  ORS 90.570;|(e)  A pro rata portion of costs to provide a utility or service to a common area;|(f)  A pro rata portion of any base or service charge billed to the landlord by the  utility or service provider, including but not limited to any tax passed  through by the provider; and|(g)  A pro rata portion of the cost to read water meters and to bill tenants for  water if:|(A)  A third party service reads the meters and bills tenants for the landlord;|(B)  The third party service charge does not include any other costs, including  costs for repairs, maintenance, inspections or collection efforts; and|(C)  The landlord allows the tenants to inspect the third party’s billing records as  provided by ORS 90.582.|(3)  Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, the landlord may not bill  or collect more money from tenants for utilities or services than the utility  or service provider charges the landlord.

[Formerly 90.536]|90.574  Conversion to submeter or pro rata billing for water. (1) A landlord  may unilaterally amend a rental agreement as provided in this section to  convert a tenant’s existing utility or service billing method for water or  wastewater:|(a)  From rent-included billing or pro rata billing to submeter billing; or|(b)  From rent-included billing to pro rata billing.|(2)  At least one month prior to installing submeters for a billing conversion under  subsection (1)(a) of this section or prior to conversion to pro rata billing  under subsection (1)(b) of this section, the landlord shall:|(a)  Deliver to each tenant a written notice that describes:|(A)  The landlord’s intention to convert the water billing method;|(B)  The proposed new water and wastewater billing method;|(C)  The reason for the conversion; and|(D)  The process and schedule for the conversion, including the date, time and  location of the meeting described in paragraph (c) of this subsection;|(b)  Deliver to each tenant a copy of a handout developed by the Housing and  Community Services Department that describes the laws regarding utility  conversions and billing; and|(c)  Meet with the tenants to explain the conversion and answer questions regarding  utility and service billing and to distribute a sample utility and service  charge statement with an explanation of each entry on the statement.|(3)  The department shall prepare a handout described in subsection (2)(b) of this  section in consultation with representatives of facility landlords and tenants.|(4)|(a)  If the landlord converts to submeter billing under this section, after the  installation of the submeters and before the landlord may convert to submeter  billing, the first three utility billing periods shall serve as a trial period  during which the landlord shall give the tenant a mock-up example of the  submeter billing for each billing period that shows what the tenant’s bill would  be using submeter billing.|(b)  Following the trial period described in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a  landlord is not required to test the submeters for accuracy.|(5)  If the landlord converts to pro rata billing under this section, after the conversion  and no less frequently than every three years, the landlord shall:|(a)  Conduct testing of every portion of any utility or service line for water that  serves the common areas and up to the connection to the dwelling or home;|(b)  Make the results of any testing available to the tenants; and|(c)  Fix any leaks within a reasonable time and consistent with ORS 90.730.|(6)  If the landlord converts from rent-included billing to pro rata billing or  submeter billing under this section, the landlord shall reduce the tenant’s  rent on a pro rata basis beginning with the landlord’s first billing of the  tenant using pro rata billing or submeter billing by no less than an amount  reasonably comparable to the amount of the rent previously allocated to the  utility or service cost averaged over at least the 12-month period of available  utility or service billings immediately preceding the first billing following  the conversion. Before the landlord first bills the tenant using pro rata  billing or submeter billing following the conversion, the landlord shall  provide the tenant with written documentation from the utility or service  provider showing the landlord’s cost for the utility or service provided to the  facility during the 12-month period used to determine the rent reduction. A  landlord may offset all or part of a rent reduction required by this subsection  against a future rent increase provided in a fixed term rental agreement  entered into prior to the delivery of the notice of conversion under subsection  (2) of this section.|(7)  A landlord that installs submeters under this section may recover from a tenant  the cost of installing the submeters, including costs to improve or repair  existing utility or service system infrastructure necessitated by the  installation of the submeters, only as follows:|(a)  By raising the rent, as with any capital expense in the facility, except that  the landlord may not raise the rent for this purpose within the first six  months after installation of the submeters; or|(b)  In a manufactured dwelling park, by imposing a special assessment pursuant to a  written special assessment plan adopted unilaterally by the landlord. The plan  may include only the landlord’s actual costs to be recovered on a pro rata  basis from each tenant with payments due no more frequently than monthly over a  period of at least 60 months. Payments must be itemized as a separate charge  from the utility or service charge. The landlord must give each tenant a copy  of the plan at least 90 days before the first payment is due. Payments may not  be due before the completion of the installation, and must begin within six  months after completion. A new tenant of a space subject to the plan may be  required to make payments under the plan. Payments must end when the plan ends.  The landlord is not required to provide an accounting of plan payments made  during or after the end of the plan.|(8)  A landlord that converts to submeter billing from rent-included billing under  this section may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to  submeters, convert the billing for common areas to pro rata billing by  including the change in the notice required by subsection (2) of this section.  If the landlord continues to use rent-included billing for common areas, the  landlord may offset against the rent reduction required by subsection (6) of  this section an amount that reflects the cost of serving the common areas. If  the utility or service provider cannot provide an accurate cost for the service  to the common areas, the landlord shall assume the cost of serving the common  areas to be 20 percent of the total cost billed. This offset is not available  if the landlord chooses to bill for the common areas using pro rata billing.|(9)  If storm water service and wastewater service are not measured by the submeter,  a landlord that installs submeters to measure water consumption and converts to  submeter billing from rent-included billing under this section may continue to  recover the cost of the storm water service or wastewater service in the rent  or may unilaterally, and at the same time as the conversion to submeters,  convert the billing for the storm water service or wastewater service to pro  rata billing by including the change in the notice and meeting required by  subsection (2) of this section. If the landlord converts the billing for the  storm water service or wastewater service to pro rata billing, the landlord  must reduce the rent to reflect that charge, as required by subsection (6) of  this section.|(10)  A rental agreement amended under this section must include language that fairly  describes the provisions of this section.|(11)  If a landlord installs a submeter on an existing utility or service line to a  space or common area that is already served by that line, unless the installation  causes a system upgrade, a local government may not assess a system development  charge as defined in ORS 223.299 as a result of the installation. |[Formerly  90.537]|90.576  Legislative findings.  The Legislative Assembly finds and declares that:|(1)  Water is an essential and scarce resource;|(2)  Conservation of water is critical for the future of this state; and|(3)  Billing for water according to usage encourages users to conserve water and  allows users to exercise better control over their costs. [Formerly 90.541]|90.578  Conversion to submeter or direct billing for large parks. (1) Except as  provided in subsections (2) and (3) of this section, a landlord that assesses  the tenants of a manufactured dwelling park containing 200 or more spaces in  the facility a utility or service charge for water by pro rata billing shall  convert the method of assessing the utility or service charge to direct billing  or submeter billing.

A conversion under this section to submeter billing is  subject to ORS 90.574.|(2)  A landlord that provides water to a manufactured dwelling park solely from a  well or from a source other than those listed in ORS 90.562 (6) is not required  to comply with subsection (1) of this section.|(3)  A landlord is not required to comply with subsection (1) of this section if the  landlord:|(a)  Bills for water provided to a space using pro rata billing by apportioning the  utility provider’s charge to tenants with, notwithstanding ORS 90.568 (2)(c),  consideration of only:|(A)  The number of tenants or occupants in the manufactured dwelling compared with  the number of tenants or occupants in the manufactured dwelling park; and|(B)  The size of a tenant’s space as a percentage of the total area of the  manufactured dwelling park.|(b)  Bases two-thirds of the charge to the tenants on the factor described in  paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection and one-third of the charge on the factor  described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection.|(c)  Determines the number of tenants or occupants in each dwelling unit and in the  manufactured dwelling park at least annually.|(d)  Demonstrates significant other conservation measures, including:|(A)  Testing for leaks in common areas of the manufactured dwelling park at least  annually, repairing significant leaks within a reasonable time and making test  results available to tenants;|(B)  Testing each occupied manufactured dwelling and space for leaks without charge  to a tenant occupying the dwelling at least annually and making test results  available to the tenant;|(C)  Posting annually in any manufactured dwelling park office and in any common  area evidence demonstrating that per capita consumption of water in the  manufactured dwelling park is below the area average for single-family  dwellings, as shown by data from the local provider of water; and|(D)  Taking one or more other reasonable measures to promote conservation of water  and to control costs, including educating tenants about water conservation,  prohibiting the washing of motor vehicles in the manufactured dwelling park and  requiring drip irrigation systems or schedules for watering landscaping.|(e)  Amends the rental agreement of each tenant to describe the provisions of this  subsection and subsection (4) of this section and to describe the use of the  pro rata billing method with additional conservation measures. The landlord may  make the amendment to the rental agreement unilaterally and must provide  written notice of the amendment to the tenant at least 60 days before the  amendment is effective.|(4)  If a landlord subject to this section adopts conservation measures described in  subsection (3) of this section to avoid having to comply with subsection (1) of  this section:|(a)  Notwithstanding ORS 90.580 or 90.725 (2), a tenant must allow a landlord access  to the tenant’s space and to the tenant’s manufactured dwelling so the landlord  can test for water leaks as provided by subsection (3)(d)(B) of this section.|(b)  The landlord must give notice consistent with ORS 90.725 (3)(e) before entering  the tenant’s space or dwelling to test for water leaks.|(c)  A landlord may require a tenant to repair a significant leak in the dwelling  found by the landlord’s test.

The warning must be  contained in at least two nonpayment of rent termination notices that precede  the third notice within a 12-month period or in separate written notices that  are given concurrent with, or a reasonable time after, each of the two  nonpayment of rent termination notices; and|(c)  The 30-day notice of termination states facts sufficient to notify the tenant  of the cause for termination of the tenancy and is given to the tenant  concurrent with or after the third or a subsequent nonpayment of rent  termination notice.|(11)  Notwithstanding subsection (5) of this section, a tenant who receives a 30-day  notice of termination pursuant to subsection (10) of this section does not have  a right to correct the cause for the notice.|(12)  The landlord may give a copy of the notice required by subsection (10) of this  section to any lienholder of the manufactured dwelling or floating home by  first class mail with certificate of mailing or by any other method allowed by  ORS 90.150 (2) and (3). A landlord is not liable to a tenant for any damages  incurred by the tenant as a result of the landlord giving a copy of the notice  in good faith to a lienholder.|90.632  Termination of tenancy due to physical condition of manufactured dwelling or  floating home; correction of condition by tenant. (1) A landlord  may terminate a month-to-month or fixed term rental agreement and require the  tenant to remove a manufactured dwelling or floating home from a facility, due  to the physical condition of the exterior of the manufactured dwelling or  floating home, only by complying with this section and ORS 105.105 to 105.168.  A termination shall include removal of the dwelling or home.|(2)  A landlord may not require removal of a manufactured dwelling or floating home,  or consider a dwelling or home to be in disrepair or deteriorated, because of  the age, size, style or original construction material of the dwelling or home  or because the dwelling or home was built prior to adoption of the National Manufactured  Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5403), in  compliance with the standards of that Act in effect at that time or in  compliance with the state building code as defined in ORS 455.010.|(3)  Except as provided in subsections (4) and (6) of this section, if the exterior  of the tenant’s dwelling or home is in disrepair or is deteriorated, a landlord  may terminate a rental agreement and require the removal of a dwelling or home  by giving to the tenant not less than 60 days’ written notice before the date  designated in the notice for termination.|(4)  If the disrepair or deterioration of the manufactured dwelling or floating home  creates a risk of imminent and serious harm to dwellings, homes or persons  within the facility, a landlord may terminate a rental agreement and require  the removal of the dwelling or home by giving to the tenant not less than 30  days’ written notice before the date designated in the notice for termination.  The notice shall describe the risk of harm.|(5)  The notice required by subsections (3) and (4) of this section must:|(a)  State facts sufficient to notify the tenant of the specific disrepair or  deterioration that is the cause or reason for termination of the tenancy and  removal of the dwelling or home;|(b)  State that the tenant can avoid termination and removal by correcting the cause  for termination and removal within the notice period;|(c)  If reasonably known by the landlord, describe specifically what repairs are  required to correct the disrepair or deterioration that is the cause for  termination;|(d)  Describe the tenant’s right to give the landlord a written notice of  correction, where to give the notice and the deadline for giving the notice in  order to ensure a response by the landlord, all as provided by subsection (7)  of this section; and|(e)  Describe the tenant’s right to have the termination and correction period  extended as provided by subsection (8) of this section.|(6)  The tenant may avoid termination of the tenancy by correcting the cause within  the period specified. However, if substantially the same condition that  constituted a prior cause for termination of which notice was given recurs  within 12 months after the date of the notice, the landlord may terminate the  tenancy and require the removal of the dwelling or home upon at least 30 days’  written notice specifying the violation and the date of termination of the  tenancy.|(7)  During the termination notice or extension period, the tenant may give the  landlord written notice that the tenant has corrected the cause for  termination. Within a reasonable time after the tenant’s notice of correction,  the landlord shall respond to the tenant in writing, stating whether the  landlord agrees that the cause has been corrected. If the tenant’s notice of  correction is given at least 14 days prior to the end of the termination notice  or extension period, failure by the landlord to respond as required by this  subsection is a defense to a termination based upon the landlord’s notice for  termination.|(8)  Except when the disrepair or deterioration creates a risk of imminent and  serious harm to dwellings, homes or persons within the facility, the 60-day  period provided for the tenant to correct the cause for termination and removal  shall be extended by at least:|(a)  An additional 60 days if:|(A)  The necessary correction involves exterior painting, roof repair, concrete  pouring or similar work and the weather prevents that work during a substantial  portion of the 60-day period; or|(B)  The nature or extent of the correction work is such that it cannot reasonably  be completed within 60 days because of factors such as the amount of work  necessary, the type and complexity of the work and the availability of  necessary repair persons;|(b)  An additional six months if the disrepair or deterioration has existed for more  than the preceding 12 months with the landlord’s knowledge or acceptance as  described in ORS 90.412; or|(c)  An additional 10 months if the disrepair or deterioration relates to the float  of a floating home.|(9)  In order to have the period for correction extended as provided in subsection  (8) of this section, a tenant must give the landlord written notice describing  the necessity for an extension in order to complete the correction work. The  notice must be given a reasonable amount of time prior to the end of the notice  for termination period.|(10)  A tenancy terminates on the date designated in the notice and without regard to  the expiration of the period for which, by the terms of the rental agreement,  rents are to be paid. Unless otherwise agreed, rent is uniformly apportionable  from day to day.|(11)  This section does not limit a landlord’s right to terminate a tenancy for  nonpayment of rent under ORS 90.394 or for other cause under ORS 90.380 (5)(b),  90.396, 90.398 or 90.630 by complying with ORS 105.105 to 105.168.|(12)  A landlord may give a copy of the notice for termination required by this  section to any lienholder of the dwelling or home, by first class mail with  certificate of mailing or by any other method allowed by ORS 90.150 (2) and  (3). A landlord is not liable to a tenant for any damages incurred by the  tenant as a result of the landlord giving a copy of the notice in good faith to  a lienholder.|(13)  When a tenant has been given a notice for termination pursuant to this section  and has subsequently abandoned the dwelling or home as described in ORS 90.675,  any lienholder shall have the same rights as provided by ORS 90.675, including  the right to correct the cause of the notice, within the 90-day period provided  by ORS 90.675 (20) notwithstanding the expiration of the notice period provided  by this section for the tenant to correct the cause. |[1999 c.603 §2b and 1999  c.676 §4; 2001 c.596 §39; 2003 c.658 §7; 2005 c.22 §66; 2005 c.391 §26; 2007  c.906 §33; 2015 c.217 §18; 2017 c.324 §2; 2019 c.625 §34]|90.634  Prohibition against lien for rent; action for possession; disposition of  dwelling or home; disposition of goods. (1) A landlord may not assert a lien  under ORS 87.162 for dwelling unit rent against a manufactured dwelling or  floating home located in a facility. Notwithstanding ORS 90.100 (47) and 90.675  and regardless of whether the owner of a manufactured dwelling or floating home  occupies the dwelling or home as a residence, a facility landlord that is  entitled to unpaid rent and receives possession of the facility space from the  sheriff following restitution pursuant to ORS 105.161 may sell or dispose of  the dwelling or home as provided in ORS 90.675.|(2)  If a manufactured dwelling or floating home was occupied immediately prior to  abandonment by a person other than the facility tenant, and the name and  address of the person are known to the landlord, a landlord selling or  disposing of the dwelling or home under subsection (1) of this section shall  promptly send the person a copy of the notice sent to the facility tenant under  ORS 90.675 (3). Notwithstanding ORS 90.425, the facility landlord may sell or  dispose of goods left in the dwelling or home or upon the dwelling unit by the  person in the same manner as if the goods were left by the facility tenant. If  the name and address of the person are known to the facility landlord, the  landlord shall promptly send the person a copy of the written notice sent to  the facility tenant under ORS 90.425 (3) and allow the person the time  described in the notice to arrange for removal of the goods.

(1) A manufactured dwelling park may be converted to  a planned community subdivision of manufactured dwellings pursuant to ORS  92.830 to 92.845. When a manufactured dwelling park is converted pursuant to  ORS 92.830 to 92.845:|(a)  Conversion does not require closure of the park pursuant to ORS 90.645 or  termination of any tenancy on any space in the park or any lot in the planned  community subdivision of manufactured dwellings.|(b)  After approval of the tentative plan under ORS 92.830 to 92.845, the  manufactured dwelling park ceases to exist, notwithstanding the possibility  that four or more lots in the planned community subdivision may be available  for rent.|(2)  If a park is converted to a subdivision under ORS 92.830 to 92.845, and the  landlord closes the park as a result of the conversion, ORS 90.645 applies to  the closure.|(3)  If a park is converted to a subdivision under ORS 92.830 to 92.845, but the  landlord does not close the park as a result of the conversion:|(a)  A tenant who does not buy the space occupied by the tenant’s manufactured  dwelling may terminate the tenancy and move. If the tenant terminates the  tenancy after receiving the notice required by ORS 92.839 and before the  expiration of the 60-day period described in ORS 92.840 (2), the landlord shall  pay the tenant as provided in ORS 90.645 (1).|(b)  If the landlord and the tenant continue the tenancy on the lot created in the  planned community subdivision, the tenancy is governed by ORS 90.100 to 90.465,  except that the following provisions apply and, in the case of a conflict,  control:|(A)  ORS 90.510 (4) to (7) applies to a rental agreement and rules and regulations  concerning the use and occupancy of the subdivision lot until the declarant  turns over administrative control of the planned community subdivision of  manufactured dwellings to a homeowners association pursuant to ORS 94.600 and  94.604 to 94.621.

However, the sale  of a lot in the planned community subdivision occupied by a tenant to someone  other than the tenant is a good cause for termination under ORS 90.630 that the  tenant cannot cure or correct and for which the landlord must give written  notice of termination that states the cause of termination at least 180 days  before termination.|(G)  ORS 90.632 applies to a termination of tenancy by a landlord due to the physical  condition of the manufactured dwelling.|(H)  ORS 90.634 applies to a lien for manufactured dwelling unit rent.|(I)  ORS 90.680 applies to the sale of a manufactured dwelling occupying a lot in  the planned community subdivision.

This  section governs the rights and obligations of landlords, tenants and any lienholders  in any personal property abandoned or left upon the premises by the tenant or  any lienholder in the following circumstances:|(a)  The tenancy has ended by termination or expiration of a rental agreement or by  relinquishment or abandonment of the premises and the landlord reasonably  believes under all the circumstances that the tenant has left the personal  property upon the premises with no intention of asserting any further claim to  the premises or to the personal property;|(b)  The tenant has been absent from the premises continuously for seven days after  termination of a tenancy by a court order that has not been executed; or|(c)  The landlord receives possession of the premises from the sheriff following  restitution pursuant to ORS 105.161.|(3)  Prior to storing, selling or disposing of the tenant’s personal property under  this section, the landlord must give a written notice to the tenant that must  be:|(a)  Personally delivered to the tenant; or|(b)  Sent by first class mail addressed and mailed to the tenant at:|(A)  The premises;|(B)  Any post-office box held by the tenant and actually known to the landlord; and|(C)  The most recent forwarding address if provided by the tenant or actually known  to the landlord.|(4)|(a)  A landlord shall also give a copy of the notice described in subsection (3) of  this section to:|(A)  Any lienholder of the personal property;|(B)  The tax collector of the county where the personal property is located; and|(C)  The assessor of the county where the personal property is located.|(b)  The landlord shall give the notice copy required by this subsection by personal  delivery or first class mail, except that for any lienholder, mail service must  be both by first class mail and by certified mail with return receipt requested.|(c)  A notice to lienholders under paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection must be sent  to each lienholder at each address:|(A)  Actually known to the landlord;|(B)  Of record; and|(C)  Provided to the landlord by the lienholder in a written notice that identifies  the personal property subject to the lien and that was sent to the landlord by  certified mail with return receipt requested within the preceding five years.

If the  landlord reasonably believes the county assessor will determine that the  current market value of the personal property is $8,000 or less, and the  landlord intends to dispose of the property if the property is not claimed, the  notice shall state that belief and intent; and|(i)  If applicable, there is a lienholder that has a right to claim the personal  property, except as provided by subsection (19) of this section.|(6)  For purposes of subsection (5) of this section, the specified date by which a  tenant or lienholder must contact a landlord to arrange for the disposition of  abandoned personal property must be not less than 45 days after personal  delivery or mailing of the notice.|(7)  After notifying the tenant as required by subsection (3) of this section, the  landlord:|(a)  Shall store the abandoned personal property of the tenant on the rented space  and shall exercise reasonable care for the personal property; and|(b)  Is entitled to reasonable or actual storage charges and costs incidental to  storage or disposal. The storage charge may be no greater than the monthly  space rent last payable by the tenant.|(8)  If a tenant or lienholder, upon the receipt of the notice provided by  subsection (3) or (4) of this section or otherwise, responds by actual notice  to the landlord on or before the specified date in the landlord’s notice that  the tenant or lienholder intends to remove the personal property from the  premises, the landlord must make that personal property available for removal  by the tenant or lienholder by appointment at reasonable times during the 30  days following the date of the response, subject to subsection (19) of this  section. If the personal property is considered to be abandoned pursuant to  subsection (2)(a) or (b) of this section, but not pursuant to subsection (2)(c)  of this section, the landlord may require payment of storage charges, as  provided in subsection (7)(b) of this section, prior to allowing the tenant or  lienholder to remove the personal property. Acceptance by a landlord of such  payment does not operate to create or reinstate a tenancy or create a waiver  pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417.|(9)  Except as provided in subsections (19) to (22) of this section, if the tenant  or lienholder does not respond within the time provided by the landlord’s  notice, or the tenant or lienholder does not remove the personal property  within 30 days after responding to the landlord or by any date agreed to with  the landlord, whichever is later, the personal property is conclusively  presumed to be abandoned. The tenant and any lienholder that have been given  notice pursuant to subsection (3) or (4) of this section shall, except with  regard to the distribution of sale proceeds pursuant to subsection (13) of this  section, have no further right, title or interest to the personal property and  may not claim or sell the property.|(10)  If the personal property is presumed to be abandoned under subsection (9) of  this section, the landlord then may:|(a)  Sell the personal property at a public or private sale, provided that prior to  the sale:|(A)  The landlord may seek to transfer ownership of record of the personal property  by complying with the requirements of the appropriate state agency; and|(B)  The landlord shall:|(i)  Place a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the  personal property is located.

Every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms  must be commercially reasonable.|(b)  If there is no buyer at a sale described under paragraph (a) of this  subsection, the personal property is considered to be worth $8,000 or less,  regardless of current market value, and the landlord shall destroy or otherwise  dispose of the personal property.|(12)  Notwithstanding ORS 446.155 (1) and (2), unless a landlord intentionally  misrepresents the condition of personal property, the landlord is not liable  for the condition of the personal property to:|(a)  A buyer of the personal property at a sale pursuant to subsection (10)(a) of  this section, with or without consideration; or|(b)  A person or nonprofit organization to whom the landlord gives the personal  property pursuant to subsection (1)(b), (10)(b) or (11)(b) of this section.|(13)|(a)  The landlord may deduct from the proceeds of the sale:|(A)  The reasonable or actual cost of notice, storage and sale; and|(B)  Unpaid rent.|(b)  After deducting the amounts listed in paragraph (a) of this subsection, the  landlord shall remit the remaining proceeds, if any, to the county tax  collector to the extent of any unpaid property taxes and assessments owed on  the dwelling or home.|(c)  After deducting the amounts listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  subsection, if applicable, the landlord shall remit the remaining proceeds, if  any, to any lienholder to the extent of any unpaid balance owed on the lien on  the personal property.|(d)  After deducting the amounts listed in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this  subsection, if applicable, the landlord shall remit to the tenant the remaining  proceeds, if any, together with an itemized accounting.|(e)  If the tenant cannot after due diligence be found, the landlord shall deposit  the remaining proceeds with the county treasurer of the county in which the  sale occurred. If not claimed within three years, the deposited proceeds revert  to the general fund of the county and are available for general purposes.|(14)  The county tax collector and the Department of Revenue shall cancel all unpaid  property taxes and special assessments as provided under ORS 305.155 and  311.790 only under one of the following circumstances:|(a)  The landlord disposes of the personal property after a determination described  in subsection (10)(b) of this section.|(b)  There is no buyer of the personal property at a sale described under subsection  (11) of this section and the landlord disposes of the property.|(c)|(A)  There is a buyer of the personal property at a sale described under subsection  (11) of this section;|(B)  The current market value of the personal property is $8,000 or less; and|(C)  The proceeds of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the unpaid property taxes  and assessments owed on the personal property after distribution of the  proceeds pursuant to subsection (13) of this section.|(d)  The landlord buys the personal property at a sale described under subsection  (11) of this section and sells the property, in compliance with subsection (15)  of this section, to a buyer who intends to occupy the property in the facility  in which the property is located.|(e)  The landlord acquires the personal property as a result of an agreement  described in subsection (24) of this section and sells the property, in  compliance with subsection (15) of this section, to a buyer who intends to  occupy the property in the facility in which the property is located.|(15)|(a)  Subsection (14)(d) and (e) of this section apply only if:|(A)  There exists a lien on the personal property for unpaid property taxes and  special assessments owed to a county or to the Department of Revenue and the  landlord files an affidavit or declaration with the county tax collector or the  Department of Revenue, as appropriate, that states:|(i)  The landlord’s intent to sell the property in an arm’s-length transaction to an  unrelated buyer who intends to occupy the property in the facility in which the  property is located; and|(ii)  That the landlord shall comply with the requirements of this subsection; and|(B)  Following the sale described in paragraph (a)(A) of this subsection, the  landlord files an affidavit or declaration with the county tax collector or the  Department of Revenue, as appropriate, that states:|(i)  That the landlord has sold the property in an arm’s-length transaction to an  unrelated buyer who intends to occupy the property in the facility in which the  property is located;|(ii)  The sale price and a description of the landlord’s claims against the property  or costs from the sale, as described under subsection (13)(a) of this section,  and any costs of improvements to the property for sale; and|(iii)  The period of time, which may not be more than is reasonably necessary, that is  taken by the landlord to complete the sale of the property.|(b)  After a landlord files the affidavit or declaration under paragraph (a)(A) of  this subsection, the county tax collector shall provide to the landlord a title  to the property that the landlord may then provide to a buyer at the time of  the sale of the property.|(c)  The affidavit or declaration described in paragraph (a)(B) of this subsection  must be accompanied by:|(A)  Payment to the county tax collector or the Department of Revenue, as  appropriate, of the amount remaining from the sale proceeds after the deduction  of the landlord’s claims and costs as described in the affidavit or  declaration, up to the amount of the unpaid taxes or tax lien. The landlord may  retain the amount of the sale proceeds that exceed the amount of the unpaid  taxes or tax lien;|(B)  Payment to the county tax collector of any county warrant fees; and|(C)  An affidavit or declaration from the buyer that states the buyer’s intent to  occupy the property in the facility in which the property is located.|(d)  Upon a showing of compliance with paragraph (c) of this subsection, the county  tax collector or the Department of Revenue shall cancel all unpaid taxes or tax  liens on the property.|(16)  The landlord is not responsible for any loss to the tenant or lienholder  resulting from storage of personal property in compliance with this section  unless the loss was caused by the landlord’s deliberate or negligent act. In  the event of a deliberate and malicious violation, the landlord is liable for  twice the actual damages sustained by the tenant or lienholder.|(17)  Complete compliance in good faith with this section shall constitute a complete  defense in any action brought by a tenant or lienholder against a landlord for  loss or damage to such personal property disposed of pursuant to this section.|(18)  If a landlord does not comply with this section:|(a)  The tenant is relieved of any liability for damage to the premises caused by  conduct that was not deliberate, intentional or grossly negligent and for  unpaid rent and may recover from the landlord up to twice the actual damages  sustained by the tenant;|(b)  A lienholder aggrieved by the noncompliance may recover from the landlord the  actual damages sustained by the lienholder. ORS 90.255 does not authorize an  award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action arising under this  paragraph; and|(c)  A county tax collector aggrieved by the noncompliance may recover from the  landlord the actual damages sustained by the tax collector, if the  noncompliance is part of an effort by the landlord to defraud the tax  collector. ORS 90.255 does not authorize an award of attorney fees to the  prevailing party in any action arising under this paragraph.|(19)  The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a  tenant to the abandoned personal property also apply to any lienholder, except  that the lienholder may not sell or remove the dwelling or home unless:|(a)  The lienholder has foreclosed the lien on the manufactured dwelling or floating  home;|(b)  The tenant or a personal representative or designated person described in  subsection (21) of this section has waived all rights under this section  pursuant to subsection (24) of this section; or|(c)  The notice and response periods provided by subsections (6) and (8) of this  section have expired.|(20)|(a)  Except as provided by subsection (21)(d) and (e) of this section, if a  lienholder makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned personal property  pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so requests, a landlord  shall enter into a written storage agreement with the lienholder providing that  the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to  12 months. A storage agreement entitles the lienholder to store the personal  property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but  does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.|(b)  The lienholder’s right to a storage agreement arises upon the failure of the  tenant or, in the case of a deceased tenant, the personal representative,  designated person, heir or devisee to remove or sell the dwelling or home  within the allotted time.|(c)  To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition  to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a)  of this subsection, the lienholder must enter into the proposed storage  agreement within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to  the lienholder. The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage  agreement to the lienholder in the same manner as provided by subsection (4)(b)  of this section. The landlord may include a copy of the proposed storage  agreement with the notice of abandoned property required by subsection (4) of  this section. A lienholder enters into a storage agreement by signing a copy of  the agreement provided by the landlord and personally delivering or mailing the  signed copy to the landlord within the 60-day period. If the tenancy is in a  marina, the proposed storage agreement is conditioned upon the tenant not  electing to enter into a storage agreement under subsection (22) of this  section.|(d)  The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by  the landlord and the lienholder, that:|(A)  The lienholder make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as  described in subsection (7)(b) of this section, accruing from the commencement  of the 45-day period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage  charge may include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.562, if  limited to charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if  incidental to the storage of personal property. A storage charge may not be due  more frequently than monthly;|(B)  The lienholder pay a late charge or fee for failure to pay a storage charge by  the date required in the agreement, if the amount of the late charge is no  greater than for late charges imposed on facility tenants;|(C)  The lienholder maintain the personal property and the space on which the  personal property is stored in a manner consistent with the rights and  obligations described in the rental agreement that the landlord currently  provides to tenants as required by ORS 90.510 (4); and|(D)  The lienholder repair any defects in the physical condition of the personal  property that existed prior to the lienholder entering into the storage  agreement, if the defects and necessary repairs are reasonably described in the  storage agreement and, for homes that were first placed on the space within the  previous 24 months, the repairs are reasonably consistent with facility  standards in effect at the time of placement. The lienholder shall have 90 days  after entering into the storage agreement to make the repairs. Failure to make  the repairs within the allotted time constitutes a violation of the storage  agreement and the landlord may terminate the agreement by giving at least 14  days’ written notice to the lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the  lienholder of the reason for termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the  violation within the notice period, the agreement terminates as provided and  the landlord may sell or dispose of the property without further notice to the  lienholder.|(e)  Notwithstanding subsection (7)(b) of this section, a landlord may increase the  storage charge if the increase is part of a facility-wide rent increase for all  facility tenants, the increase is no greater than the increase for other  tenants and the landlord gives the lienholder written notice consistent with  the requirements of ORS 90.600.|(f)  During the term of an agreement described under this subsection, the lienholder  has the right to remove or sell the property, subject to the provisions of the  lien. Selling the property includes a sale to a purchaser who wishes to leave  the property on the rented space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions  of ORS 90.680. The landlord may condition approval for occupancy of any  purchaser of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and  maintenance costs.|(g)|(A)  Except as provided in paragraph (d)(D) of this subsection, if the lienholder  violates the storage agreement, the landlord may terminate the agreement by  giving at least 90 days’ written notice to the lienholder stating facts  sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for the termination. Unless  the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement  terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property  without further notice to the lienholder.|(B)  After a landlord gives a termination notice pursuant to subparagraph (A) of  this paragraph for failure of the lienholder to pay a storage charge and the  lienholder corrects the violation, if the lienholder again violates the storage  agreement by failing to pay a subsequent storage charge, the landlord may  terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the  lienholder stating facts sufficient to notify the lienholder of the reason for  termination. Unless the lienholder corrects the violation within the notice  period, the agreement terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or  dispose of the property without further notice to the lienholder.|(C)  A lienholder may terminate a storage agreement at any time upon at least 14  days’ written notice to the landlord and may remove the property from the  facility if the lienholder has paid all storage charges and other charges as  provided in the agreement.|(h)  Upon the failure of a lienholder to enter into a storage agreement as provided  by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement, unless the parties  otherwise agree or the lienholder has sold or removed the property, the  landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant to this section without  further notice to the lienholder.|(21)  If the personal property is considered abandoned as a result of the death of a  tenant who was the only tenant, this section applies, except as follows:|(a)  The provisions of this section regarding the rights and responsibilities of a  tenant to the abandoned personal property shall apply to any personal  representative named in a will or appointed by a court to act for the deceased  tenant or any person designated in writing by the tenant to be contacted by the  landlord in the event of the tenant’s death.|(b)  The notice required by subsection (3) of this section must be:|(A)  Sent by first class mail to the deceased tenant at the premises; and|(B)  Personally delivered or sent by first class mail to any personal representative  or designated person if actually known to the landlord.|(c)  The notice described in subsection (5) of this section must refer to any  personal representative or designated person, instead of the deceased tenant,  and must incorporate the provisions of this subsection.|(d)  If a personal representative, designated person or other person entitled to  possession of the property, such as an heir or devisee, responds by actual  notice to a landlord within the 45-day period provided by subsection (6) of  this section and so requests, the landlord shall enter into a written storage  agreement with the representative or person providing that the personal  property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for up to 90 days or  until conclusion of any probate proceedings, whichever is later. A storage  agreement entitles the representative or person to store the personal property  on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement, but does not  entitle anyone to occupy the personal property. If such an agreement is  entered, the landlord may not enter a similar agreement with a lienholder  pursuant to subsection (20) of this section until the agreement with the  personal representative or designated person ends.|(e)  If a personal representative or other person requests that a landlord enter  into a storage agreement, subsection (20)(c) to (e) and (g)(C) of this section  applies, with the representative or person having the rights and  responsibilities of a lienholder with regard to the storage agreement.|(f)  During the term of an agreement described under paragraph (d) of this  subsection, the representative or person has the right to remove or sell the  property, including a sale to a purchaser or a transfer to an heir or devisee  where the purchaser, heir or devisee wishes to leave the property on the rented  space and become a tenant, subject to the provisions of ORS 90.680. The  landlord also may condition approval for occupancy of any purchaser, heir or  devisee of the property upon payment of all unpaid storage charges and  maintenance costs.|(g)  If the representative or person violates the storage agreement, the landlord  may terminate the agreement by giving at least 30 days’ written notice to the  representative or person stating facts sufficient to notify the representative  or person of the reason for the termination. Unless the representative or  person corrects the violation within the notice period, the agreement  terminates as provided and the landlord may sell or dispose of the property  without further notice to the representative or person.|(h)  Upon the failure of a representative or person to enter into a storage  agreement as provided by this subsection or upon termination of an agreement,  unless the parties otherwise agree or the representative or person has sold or  removed the property, the landlord may sell or dispose of the property pursuant  to this section without further notice to the representative or person.|(22)|(a)  If a tenant of a marina makes a timely response to a notice of abandoned  personal property pursuant to subsections (6) and (8) of this section and so  requests, and has not entered into a storage agreement under ORS 90.545 (7), a  landlord shall enter into a written storage agreement with the tenant providing  that the personal property may not be sold or disposed of by the landlord for  up to 12 months. A storage agreement entitles the tenant to store the personal  property on the previously rented space during the term of the agreement but  does not entitle anyone to occupy the personal property.|(b)  To exercise the right to a storage agreement under this subsection, in addition  to contacting the landlord with a timely response as described in paragraph (a)  of this subsection, the tenant must enter into the proposed storage agreement  within 60 days after the landlord gives a copy of the agreement to the tenant.  The landlord shall give a copy of the proposed storage agreement to the tenant  in the same manner as provided by subsection (3) of this section. The landlord  may include a copy of the proposed storage agreement with the notice of  abandoned property required by subsection (3) of this section. A tenant enters  into a storage agreement by signing a copy of the agreement provided by the  landlord and personally delivering or mailing the signed copy to the landlord  within the 60-day period.|(c)  The storage agreement may require, in addition to other provisions agreed to by  the landlord and the tenant, that:|(A)  The tenant make timely periodic payment of all storage charges, as described in  subsection (7)(b) of this section, accruing from the commencement of the 45-day  period described in subsection (6) of this section. A storage charge may  include a utility or service charge, as described in ORS 90.562, if limited to  charges for electricity, water, sewer service and natural gas and if incidental  to the storage of personal property.

The landlord shall disclose to the seller in  writing that the rejection is based upon information contained within a consumer  report and that the landlord may not disclose the information within the  report.|(11)  The following apply if a landlord does not require a prospective purchaser to  submit an application for occupancy as a tenant under subsection (8) of this  section or if the landlord does not accept or reject the prospective purchaser  as a tenant within the time required under subsection (10) of this section:|(a)  The landlord waives any right to bring an action against the tenant under the  rental agreement for breach of the landlord’s right to establish conditions  upon and approve a prospective purchaser of the tenant’s dwelling or home;|(b)  The prospective purchaser, upon completion of the sale, may occupy the dwelling  or home as a tenant under the same conditions and terms as the tenant who sold  the dwelling or home; and|(c)  If the prospective purchaser becomes a new tenant, the landlord may impose  conditions or terms on the tenancy that are inconsistent with the terms and  conditions of the seller’s rental agreement only if the new tenant agrees in  writing.|(12)  A landlord may not, because of the age, size, style or original construction  material of the dwelling or home or because the dwelling or home was built  prior to adoption of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety  Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5403), in compliance with the standards of  that Act in effect at that time or in compliance with the state building code  as defined in ORS 455.010:|(a)  Reject an application for tenancy from a prospective purchaser of an existing  dwelling or home on a rented space within a facility; or|(b)  Require a prospective purchaser of an existing dwelling or home on a rented  space within a facility to remove the dwelling or home from the rented space.|(13)  A tenant who has received a notice pursuant to ORS 90.632 may sell the tenant’s  dwelling or home in compliance with this section during the notice period.

Payment of the storage charges or  maintenance of the dwelling or home and the space does not create or reinstate  a tenancy or create a waiver pursuant to ORS 90.412 or 90.417. A former tenant  may not enter the premises without the written permission of the landlord,  including entry to maintain the dwelling or home or the space or to facilitate  a sale.|(16)  A landlord or tenant who sells a manufactured dwelling or floating home shall  deliver title to the dwelling or home to the purchaser within 25 business days  after completion of the sale.

(1) The State of Oregon encourages affordable housing options for all  Oregonians. One housing alternative chosen by many Oregonians is facility  living. The Legislative Assembly finds that many facility tenants would like to  join together, alone or in cooperation with an associated entity, to purchase  the facility in which the tenants live in order to have greater control over  the costs and environment of their housing. The Legislative Assembly also finds  that current market conditions place tenants at a disadvantage with other  potential investors in the purchase of facilities.|(2)  It is the policy of the State of Oregon to encourage facility tenants to  participate in the housing marketplace by ensuring that technical assistance,  financing opportunities, notice of sale of facilities and the option to  purchase facilities are made available to tenants who choose to participate in  the purchase of a facility.|(3)  The purpose of ORS 90.800 to 90.850, 456.579 and 456.581 is to strengthen the  private housing market in Oregon by encouraging all Oregonians to have the  ability to participate in the purchase of housing of their choice. |[1989 c.919 §1;  1991 c.844 §24; 1995 c.559 §42; 2014 c.89 §7; 2017 c.315 §1]|90.805 [Formerly 90.760;  repealed by 2019 c.625 §25]|90.810 |[1989 c.919 §8;  1991 c.844 §25; 1995 c.559 §43; 2014 c.89 §8; repealed by 2019 c.625 §25]|90.815 [1989 c.919 §9;  1991 c.844 §26; 2014 c.89 §9; repealed by 2019 c.625 §25]|90.820 [1989 c.919 §10;  1991 c.844 §19; 1999 c.222 §1; 1999 c.603 §34a; 2009 c.295 §1; 2014 c.89 §10;  repealed by 2019 c.625 §25]|90.830 [1989 c.919 §11;  1991 c.844 §27; 1999 c.222 §2; 2014 c.89 §11; repealed by 2019 c.625 §25]|90.840  Park purchase funds, loans.
