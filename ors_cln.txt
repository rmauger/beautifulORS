In whichever way the vacancy is filled, the new trustee shall hold the property with all powers, rights and duties of an original trustee unless otherwise directed by conveyance, deed of trust, mortgage or devise, or order or judgment of the court.|[Amended by 1969 c.591 §275; 2003 c.576 §353]|93.200|#Trustees or executors now hold as joint tenants.|!All trustees or executors holding real or personal property in trust on May 19, 1905, hold as joint tenants and not as tenants in common unless the conveyance, deed of trust, mortgage or devise, or order or decree of court creating or appointing the trustees or executors has declared otherwise.|93.210|#Presumption respecting deed from trustee of undisclosed beneficiary.|!If a deed to real estate has been made to a grantee in trust or designating the grantee as trustee, and no beneficiary is indicated or named in the deed, a deed thereafter executed by such grantee conveying the property is presumed to have been executed with full right and authority and conveys prima facie title to the property.

If the last-mentioned deed is recorded after June 7, 1937, after five years from its recording or, if it was recorded prior to June 7, 1937, then after June 7, 1942, the presumption is conclusive as to any undisclosed beneficiary and the title to the real estate, based upon the last-mentioned deed, shall not be called in question by any one claiming as beneficiary under the first-mentioned deed.|93.220|#Release, limitation or restriction of power of appointment.|(1) Any person to whom there has been granted or reserved any power of appointment or other power by which the person may elect to take any action affecting the disposition of property may at any time release, or, from time to time, limit or restrict such power in whole or in part by an instrument in writing evidencing that purpose and subscribed by the person.|(2) If the power is one to affect title to real property, the instrument shall be executed, acknowledged, proved and recorded, or filed with the registrar of title in each county in which the land is situated in the same manner as a conveyance of real property.|(3) If the power is of such nature that its exercise may affect the duty of any trustee or other fiduciary, such trustee or other fiduciary is not bound to take notice thereof unless the trustee or other fiduciary has received the original or an executed duplicate of the release or a copy thereof certified by the county clerk or county recorder of the county in which it has been recorded.|93.230|#Copy of Department of State Lands deed or patent given when original lost.|(1) If parties to whom deeds have been issued by the Department of State Lands have lost such deeds before they were placed on record in the county wherein the land conveyed is located, the Director of the Department of State Lands, on application of the party entitled thereto, shall cause a certified copy of the record of the deed in the office of the department to be issued under its seal.|(2) If parties to whom patents for lands have been issued by the United States for lands in the State of Oregon have lost such patents before they were placed on record in the county wherein the land conveyed is located, such parties, or their successors in interest, may apply to and obtain from the Bureau of Land Management, or its successor agency, copies of the records of such patents, duly certified to be correct copies of the original patents, or of the record thereof, by the appropriate federal officer.|(3) Every certified copy issued in accordance with subsection (1) or (2) of this section is entitled to record in the proper county with like effect as the original deed or patent. Every such copy so certified may be read in evidence in any court in this state without further proof thereof. The record of any such certified copy, or a transcript thereof certified by the county clerk in whose office it may have been recorded, may be read in evidence in any court in this state with like effect as the original thereof or the original lost deed or patent.|[Amended by 1967 c.421 §197]|93.240|#Rights to deferred installments of purchase price where two or more persons join as sellers of real property.|(1) Subject to the provisions contained in this section, whenever two or more persons join as sellers in the execution of a contract of sale of real property or sell and convey title to real property in exchange for a note for all or a part of the purchase price secured by either a mortgage or trust deed on the real property, unless a contrary purpose is expressed in the contract, note, mortgage or trust deed, the right to receive payment of deferred installments of the purchase price and the mortgage or trust deed, shall be owned by them in the same proportions, and with the same incidents, as title to the real property was vested in them immediately preceding the execution of the contract of sale or conveyance.|(2) If immediately prior to the execution of a contract of sale of real property, or a sale or conveyance of title to real property in exchange for a note for all or a part of the purchase price secured by a mortgage or trust deed on the real property, title to any interest in the property therein described was vested in the sellers or some of the sellers as tenants by the entirety or was otherwise subject to any right of survivorship, then, unless a contrary purpose is expressed in the contract, note, mortgage or trust deed, the right to receive payment of deferred installments of the purchase price of the property and the mortgage and trust deed shall likewise be subject to like rights of survivorship.|[1957 c.402 §§1,2; 1969 c.591 §276; 1989 c.74 §1; 1997 c.99 §21]|93.250|#Effect of conveyance creating fee simple conditional or fee tail.|!Every conveyance or devise of lands, or interest therein, made subsequent to September 9, 1971, using language appropriate to create a fee simple conditional or fee tail estate shall create an estate in fee simple absolute in the grantees or devisees of such conveyances or devises.
